10446223|08/03/2020|IN|MAF|IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY INTERVENTION, A 3.5 X 23MM XIENCE SIERRA STENT WAS ADVANCED BUT FAILED TO REACH THE LESION. ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT PERFORATION. PATIENT BECAME HYPOTENSIVE AND WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST. CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION WAS PERFORMED, AND A TEMPORARY PACEMAKER WAS PLACED, SUCCESSFULLY REVIVING THE PATIENT. A 3.5X26MM GRAFTMASTER STENT SYSTEM WAS ADVANCED BUT FAILED TO REACH THE PERFORATION AND WAS REMOVED WITHOUT ISSUE. TWO ADDITIONAL GRAFTMASTER STENTS (3.5X19MM, 3.5X16MM) WERE ADVANCED AND SUCCESSFULLY SEALED THE PERFORATION; HOWEVER, A DISTAL EDGE DISSECTION WAS NOTED. A 3X12MM XIENCE SIERRA STENT WAS IMPLANTED TO SUCCESSFULLY TREAT THE DISSECTION. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THIS PROCEDURE, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS AND WAS PLACED ON AN INTRA-ARTERIAL BALLOON PUMP. AORTIC BALLOON VALVOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED, WITH GOOD RESULTS. POST PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT REMAINED IN CRITICAL CONDITION WITH A POOR PROGNOSIS. LATER THAT EVENING, THE PATIENT DIED FROM PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY. THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED.
10449978|08/03/2020|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT DIED. THE 50% STENOSED TARGET LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE NON-CALCIFIED AND SEVERELY TORTUOUS LEFT INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY TO DISTAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY. A 2.25X16MM SYNERGY II DRUG-ELUTING STENT WAS ADVANCED BUT FAILED TO CROSS THE LESION. SUBSEQUENTLY, A 2.25X12MM SYNERGY II DRUG-ELUTING STENT WAS USED BUT HAD DIFFICULTY ADVANCING. THE DEVICE WAS ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE BUT THE STENT WAS DISLODGED AT THE ANASTOMOSIS. A 2.0X12MM EMERGE BALLOON CATHETER WAS ADVANCED AND DEPLOY THE STENT WITH TWO INFLATIONS AT 18 ATMOSPHERES FOR 16 SECONDS EACH. AFTERWARDS, A SLOW FLOW DOWN IN THE VESSEL WAS OBSERVED. NITROGLYCERIN WAS GIVEN TO RESTORE NORMAL BLOOD FLOW; HOWEVER, THE VESSEL STILL HAD SLOW FLOW. THE PHYSCIAN TRIED GOING BACK IN WITH AN INTERVENTIONAL WIRE TO BALLOON IT UP BUT IT ENDED LEAVING IT AS IS. THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE FLOOR AND LATER IN THE AFTERNOON, THE PATIENT CODED AND EXPIRED LATER THE SAME NIGHT.
10451761|08/03/2020|IN|MAF|IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY INTERVENTION, A 3.5 X 23MM XIENCE SIERRA STENT WAS ADVANCED BUT FAILED TO REACH THE LESION. ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT PERFORATION. PATIENT BECAME HYPOTENSIVE AND WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST.

LATER THAT EVENING, THE PATIENT DIED FROM PULSELESS ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY. THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED.
10484841|08/04/2020|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT ON (B)(6) 2020, THIS WAS A PLANNED PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION OF BOTH THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) CORONARY AND RAMUS INTERMEDIUS ARTERIES WITH IMPELLA SUPPORT DUE TO SEVERELY DEPRESSED BIVENTRICULAR FUNCTION. A NON-ABBOTT STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE RAMUS. A PROWATER GUIDE WIRE WAS USED TO DELIVER A CORSAIR PRO XS MICROCATHETER HOWEVER, THE TIP OF THE MICROCATHETER BECAME SEPARATED. FLUOROSCOPY WAS USED TO VERIFY THE TIP WAS STILL ON THE GUIDE WIRE. IT WAS THEN ATTEMPTED TO SNARE THE TIP OF THE MICRO CATHETER WITH A 4MM GOOSENECK SNARE, BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE LAD WAS CROSSED AND PRE-DILATATION WAS PERFORMED WITH AN UNSPECIFIED BALLOON. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, ABRUPT HYPOTENSION OCCURRED, AND A CORONARY PERFORATION WAS SUSPECTED. A BALLOON WAS INFLATED TO TEMPORARILY HALT FLOW INTO THE LAD IN ORDER TO STOP THE BLEEDING. PERICARDIOCENTESIS WAS ATTEMPTED, BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE PATIENT WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST AND CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION WAS PERFORMED FOR 20 MINUTES WITH DEFIBRILLATION, AND THE PATIENT WAS RESUSCITATED. THE ANGIOGRAM SHOWED A LARGE THROMBUS BURDEN IN THE LEFT MAIN ARTERY. IT WAS UNCLEAR IF THROMBUS WAS THE CAUSE OF ACUTE DECOMPENSATION, OR IF IT DEVELOPED DURING PROLONGED RESUSCITATIVE EFFORT. HEPARIN AND ASPIRATION THROMBECTOMY WERE PERFORMED WITH COMPLETE RESOLUTION OF THE THROMBUS. A DISSECTION WAS MADE IN THE LAD IN ORDER TO CROSS THE CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUDED (CTO) LESION, AND WAS NOTED AS EXPECTED WITHOUT CONTRAST EXTRAVASATION OR EVIDENCE OF PERFORATION. INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND (IVUS) WAS THEN PERFORMED, AND REVEALED POSSIBLE PLAQUE SHIFT IN THE LEFT CIRCUMFLEX (LCX), WHICH WAS TREATED WITH A 3.0X38MM XIENCE SIERRA STENT. DUE TO PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION REQUIRING MEDICATION, A REPEAT ECHOCARDIOGRAM WAS PERFORMED, AND REVEALED ENLARGING PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. PERICARDIOCENTESIS WAS PERFORMED WITH REMOVAL OF ABOUT 500 CC FLUID. PATIENT¿S HEMODYNAMICS IMPROVED TRANSIENTLY, BUT REMAINED TENUOUS AND THE PERICARDIAL DRAIN CONTINUED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT OUTPUT. BOTH A NON-ABBOTT STENT AND A 4.0X19MM GRAFT MASTER COVERED STENT WERE IMPLANTED IN OVERLAPPING FASHION IN THE LCX AND LEFT MAIN TO INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDE THE LAD IN ORDER TO STOP THE BLEEDING GIVEN THE UNCLEAR SOURCE OF BLOOD LOSS. AFTER COVERED STENT PLACEMENT TO STOP THE FLOW INTO THE LAD, THE PERICARDIAL DRAIN OUTPUT SLOWED AS EXPECTED. DUE TO PERSISTENT PERICARDIAL DRAIN OUTPUT, HEPARIN EFFECT WAS REVERSED WITH PROTAMINE 10 MG. AFTERWARD, THE PERICARDIAL DRAIN OUTPUT SLOWED EVEN FURTHER. THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CARDIAC CARE UNIT (CCU) IN TENUOUS, CRITICAL CONDITION. THE PATIENT EXPIRED THE NEXT DAY ON (B)(6) 2020, SECONDARY TO RIGHT VENTRICLE LACERATION FOLLOWING WITHDRAWAL OF CARE POST PROCEDURE. IT WAS NOTED THE GRAFT MASTER DID NOT CAUSE THE LACERATION. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.
10498050|07/21/2020|IN|MAF|IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) AND CARDIOGENIC SHOCK AND DURING TREATMENT OF THE MI, A PERFORATION OCCURRED IN THE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY. A 3.5X16MM GRAFTMASTER WAS NOTED TO BE EXPIRED. THE DEVICE WAS NOT USED AND THERE WAS NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT. A 2.8X16MM GRAFTMASTER FAILED TO CROSS DUE TO THE ANATOMY. ANOTHER 2.8X16MM GRAFTMASTER COVERED STENT WAS ADVANCED, BUT DISLODGED IN THE LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY WHICH MADE THINGS MORE CHALLENGING. THE SAME STENT BALLOON WAS USED TO FULLY APPOSE THE DISLODGED STENT TO THE VESSEL WALL; HOWEVER, IT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE PERFORATED AREA. LASTLY, A 3.5X16MM GRAFTMASTER COVERED STENT WAS DEPLOYED AND SUCCESSFULLY SEALED THE PERFORATION. THE PATIENT EXPIRED ON (B)(6) 2020 DUE TO THE MI, CARDIOGENIC SHOCK AND PERFORATION. IN THE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN, THE USE OF THESE GRAFTMASTERS DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO THE PATIENT DEATH IN ANY WAY. THE PATIENT'S HEALTH WAS DECLINING TOWARD DEATH (MI, CARDIOGENIC SHOCK, AND PERFORATION) PRIOR TO ANY GRAFTMASTER USE. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.
10564373|08/27/2020|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED TO TREAT A MILDLY TORTUOUS AND MODERATELY CALCIFIED DE NOVO LESION WITH A SPONTANEOUS CORONARY ARTERY DISSECTION IN THE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD). THE PATIENT DEVELOPED CARDIORESPIRATORY ARREST WITH VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION AT RECOVERY. CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION WAS PERFORMED THREE TIMES FOR ABOUT 5-10 MINUTES EACH. A NON-ABBOTT GUIDE WIRE WAS ADVANCED AND A 3.5X38MM XIENCE XPEDITION STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM (SDS) WAS ADVANCED; HOWEVER, THE SDS FAILED TO CROSS THE LESION. AN ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE SDS WAS MADE BUT THE PROXIMAL STENT PROFILE WAS TRAPPED IN THE GUIDE CATHETER. UNDER FLUOROSCOPY, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE STENT STRUT WAS PARTIALLY INFLATED AND THE WHOLE STENT PROFILE LOOK BIGGER EVEN THOUGH NO PRESSURE HAD BEEN APPLIED WITH THE INDEFLATOR. IT WAS THEN DECIDED TO PULL THE WHOLE SYSTEM OUT UNDER FLUOROSCOPY. DURING REMOVAL OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM, IT WAS OBSERVED UNDER FLUOROSCOPY THAT THE STENT REMAINED ON THE SDS STUCK WITH THE GUIDE CATHETER. WHEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS REMOVED OUT FROM THE PATIENT FEMORAL PUNCTURE POINT, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE STENT WAS NO LONGER ON THE SDS AND HAD DISLODGED. THE GUIDE CATHETER WAS CUT APART, BUT THE STENT WAS NOT FOUND. UNDER FLUOROSCOPY, THE STENT WAS NOT FOUND INSIDE THE INTRODUCER SHEATH. THE LEFT CORONARY SYSTEM WAS CHECKED, AND THE STENT COULD NOT BE SEEN. IT WAS DECIDED TO REATTEMPT USING THE LEFT FEMORAL PUNCTURE ASSESS SITE AND A NON-ABBOTT GUIDE WIRE WAS ADVANCED INTO THE LAD. A 3.5X38MM NON-ABBOTT STENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED IN THE PROXIMAL TO MID LAD WITH NO IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS. THERE WAS A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE PROCEDURE. THE NEXT DAY THE PATIENT EXPIRED DUE TO METABOLIC ACIDOSIS. THE PHYSICIAN CONFIRMED THAT THE USE OF THE XIENCE XPEDITION DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO THE PATIENT'S DEATH. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.
10572278|12/31/2019|IN|NIQ|DURING INDEX PROCEDURE, AN ENDEAVOR SPRINT DRUG-ELUTING STENT WAS IMPLANTED. APPROXIMATELY 50 MONTHS POST PROCEDURE, PATIENT SUFFERED CEREBRAL INFARCTION AND WAS TREATED WITH MEDICATION. TWO WEEKS LATER, PATIENT DIED OF CENTRAL RESPIRATORY FAILURE. DEATH IS CLASSIFIED AS A VASCULAR DEATH.
10630166|09/06/2020|IN|MAF|IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A FREE PERFORATION IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY. A 2.8X16MM GRAFTMASTER COVERED STENT WAS DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY AND SEALED THE AREA WHERE IT WAS PLACED BUT FAILED TO SEAL THE PERFORATION AS THE PERFORATION WAS LARGE AND NEEDED ANOTHER STENT. ANOTHER 2.8X16MM GRAFTMASTER COVERED STENT WAS DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY AND SEALED THE AREA WHERE IT WAS PLACED BUT FAILED TO SEAL THE PERFORATION AS THE PERFORATION WAS LARGER THAN ANTICIPATED AND NEEDED ANOTHER STENT. A 2.8X16MM GRAFTMASTER COVERED STENT FAILED TO CROSS DUE TO THE ANATOMY, SO IT WAS REMOVED. A NON-ABBOTT STENT WAS USED TO FINISH SEALING THE LAST SMALL PORTION OF THE PERFORATION AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE. HOWEVER, THE PATIENT EXPIRED ON (B)(6) 2020 DUE TO CARDIAC FAILURE, RESULTING FROM THE PRIOR CONDITION OF THE PATIENT. IN THE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN, THE USE OF THIS GRAFTMASTER DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO COMPLICATIONS, ADVERSE EVENTS, OR DEATH IN ANY WAY. THE PATIENT'S HEALTH WAS DECLINING TOWARD DEATH PRIOR TO GRAFTMASTER USE. THE FIRST TWO GRAFTMASTER STENTS SEALED THE AREAS WHERE THEY WERE PLACED AND DID NOT HAVE ANY DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.
10680435|09/15/2020|IN|MAF|IT WAS REPORTED THAT ON (B)(6) 2020, THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH ALERTED MENTAL STATUS, DYSPNEA, AND A NON-ST ELEVATED MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI). THERE WAS POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE INCLUDING AMPHETAMINES, COCAINE, AND ALCOHOL. A DIAGNOSTIC CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION WAS PERFORMED DEMONSTRATING SEVERE MULTI-VESSEL CORONARY ARTERY WITH A SEVERELY REDUCED EJECTION FRACTION (EF) OF 15%, SEVERE ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY. A PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) WAS PERFORMED ON THE FIRST OBTUSE MARGINAL AND THE PATIENT WAS RECOMMENDED FOR A CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT, HOWEVER, THE PATIENT WAS DEEMED TOO HIGH RISK. ON (B)(6) 2020, THE PATIENT PRESENTED FOR A COMPLEX CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSION (CTO) PCI OF THE RCA. DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE RCA TREATMENT SITE WAS NOTED WITH SEVERAL NON-ABBOTT DEVICES. A PILOT 200 GUIDEWIRE SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCED TO THE MID RCA WITHOUT AN ISSUE NOTED. FOLLOWING HOWEVER, A NON-ABBOTT CATHETER (MAMBA) WAS UNABLE TO TRACK THE PILOT GUIDEWIRE. ANOTHER NON-ABBOTT CATHETER (GUTTER) SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCED THE PILOT GUIDEWIRE INTO THE RCA. ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED FROM THE PROXIMAL, MID, AND DISTAL RCA. A NON-ABBOTT (GUIDEZILLA) GUIDE CATHETER ADVANCED OVER THE UNSPECIFIED 2.5MM BALLOON AND INTO THE MID RCA. A 2.5X38MM NON-ABBOTT STENT (SYNERGY) WAS IMPLANTED IN THE DISTAL RCA, OVERLAPPED IN THE MID RCA WITH ANOTHER 2.5X38MM NON-ABBOTT STENT (SYNERGY), AND A 3.0X24MM NON-ABBOTT STENT (SYNERGY) WAS IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL RCA. POST-DILATATION WAS PERFORMED WITH A 3MM NONCOMPLIANT, UNSPECIFIED BALLOON. FOLLOWING, EXTRAVASATION OF THE MID RCA WAS OBSERVED, CONSISTENT WITH A PERFORATION. BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED FOR TAMPONADE OF THE PERFORATION. PER IMAGING. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF TAMPONADE OR SIGNIFICANT PERICARDIAL FLUID. A 2.8MM GRAFTMASTER FAILED TO CROSS TO THE MID RCA. PER PHYSICIAN, THIS FAILURE TO ADVANCE WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED (NON-ABBOTT) STENTS. THE GRAFTMASTER DEVICE FAILED TO ADVANCE THROUGH THE STENTS. REPEAT BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED IN THE MID RCA FOR TAMPONADE. ANOTHER CATHETER AND SHEATH (NON-ABBOTT) WERE EXCHANGED, ENGAGING THE RCA. A GUIDE CATHETER EXTENSION WAS PLACED AND ANOTHER 2.8MM GRAFTMASTER FAILED TO CROSS THE MID RCA. THE EXTENSION WAS REMOVED AND A BUDDY WIRE (NOT SPECIFIED) ALONG WITH A NON-ABBOTT CATHETER ADVANCED TO THE DISTAL RCA. MULTIPLE ADVANCEMENT ATTEMPTS WERE PERFORMED, HOWEVER, THE GRAFTMASTER DEVICES HAD FAILED TO ADVANCE TO THE TREATMENT SITE. BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED AND CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY CONSULTED. THE FAMILY WAS CONSULTED DUE TO THE PATIENTS HIGH RISK, POOR EF, MULTI-VESSEL DISEASE, AND COMORBIDITIES. THE FAMILY DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH SURGERY. THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON MEDICATIONS (DOPAMINE AND LEVOPHED) TO MAINTAIN BLOOD PRESSURE. ATROPINE WAS PROVIDED FOR BRADYCARDIA. COMFORT MEASURES WERE THEN AGREED UPON BY THE FAMILY. ON (B)(6) 2020, THE PATIENT EXPIRED. PER PHYSICIAN, THE GRAFTMASTER DEVICES DID NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO THE PATIENTS DEATH. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED REGARDING THIS ISSUE.

THE 4TH 3.50X38MM HAD A REPORTED DEFLATION ISSUE. DURING REMOVAL THE DEVICE SEPARATED AND THE PATIENT THEN DIED. AN AUTOPSY REVEALED A 32CM LONG CATHETER SECTION WITH A BALLOON WAS FOUND IN THE AORTA UP TO THE HEART VALVES. A FOLLOW-UP CALL TO BFARM PROVIDED HOSPITAL NAME AND ADVISED DR. (B)(6) PERFORMED THE PROCEDURE. THE FIRST NOTIFICATION TO ABBOTT WAS FROM BFARM ON NOV 9, 2020, WHICH IS WHY THIS EVENT WAS NOT RECORDED IN 2019. FURTHER FOLLOW UP WITH DR. (B)(6) CONFIRMED THE COMPLAINT WAS NOT REPORTED TO ABBOTT DURING THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT AS SHE DID NOT IDENTIFY A DEVICE ISSUE HAD OCCURRED. SHE CONFIRMS THAT THERE WAS NO DEFLATION ISSUE NOTED WITH THE COMPLAINT DEVICE AND NO ALLEGATION AGAINST ABBOTT. PER THE PHYSICIAN¿S OPINION, THE PATIENT DIED BECAUSE OF PROCEDURAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE STATE OF THE PATIENT¿S OVERALL CONDITION. THE PATIENT HAD A HISTORY OF ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFRACTION (STEMI) WITH CORONARY THREE-VESSEL DISEASE, SEVERE STENOSIS RIVA AND PROXIMAL RCX AND HAD PREVIOUSLY SUFFERED A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. ABBOTT WAS UNABLE TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION OF THE DEVICE AS IT WAS NEVER RETURNED.

A CORONARY STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE NEAR TOTAL OCCLUSION IN THE HEAVILY CALCIFIED LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) CORONARY ARTERY, BUT THE STENT WAS NOT WELL APPOSED TO THE VESSEL WALL. NON-COMPLIANT BALLOON DILATATION CATHETERS WERE USED TO BETTER APPOSE THE STENT TO THE WALL, BUT A PERFORATION OCCURRED IN THE LAD WHERE THE STENT WAS. THE PATIENT WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST AND CARDIOCENTESIS WAS PERFORMED. THE PATIENT WAS RESUSCITATED AND THE FIRST GRAFTMASTER STENT WAS INSERTED TO TREAT THE PERFORATION, BUT IT WAS UNABLE TO CROSS THE VESSEL. THE FAILURE TO CROSS COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE HEAVILY CALCIFIED, PATIENT ANATOMY OR THE NEWLY DEPLOYED STENT. A SECOND GRAFTMASTER WAS INSERTED AND WAS IMPLANTED INSIDE THE NEWLY DEPLOYED STENT. THE PERFORATION WAS SEALED AND THE PATIENT WAS TALKING AND STABLE WHEN SHE LEFT THE CATHETERIZATION LAB. THE PATIENT EXPIRED THE SAME DAY WHEN SHE WAS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. SHE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A BLOOD SUGAR OF 700. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS EITHER SEPTIC OR CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. THE GRAFTMASTER DID NOT CAUSE ANY ADVERSE EVENTS. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.

1948173|04/28/2010|IN|NIQ|THE COMPLAINT RECEIVED STATES THAT (B)(4) STUDY PATIENT SUFFERED CORONARY ARTERY OCCLUSION AND ANGINA. THIS IS A (B)(6) MALE WITH MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING HYPERTENSION, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, AND HISTORY OF COMPLETE HEART BLOCKED, HISTORY OF HEMOCHROMATOSIS AND HISTORY OF MILD BILATERAL CAROTID DISEASE. THE TARGET LESION WAS MID LAD DESCRIBED AS REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER OF 3.5MM, LESION LENGTH 30MM, DE NOVO, CLASS C, AND ANATOMICALLY COMPLEX. INTEGRILIN WAS USED FOR THE PROCEDURE. ASA AND PLAVIX WERE ADMINISTERED PERI-PROCEDURALLY. POST-IMPLANT, A SIDE BRANCH OCCLUSION WAS NOTED. THIS WAS TREATED WITH POBA. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. PATIENT'S POST PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX. AT THE ONE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP VISIT THE PATIENT REPORTED HAVING STABLE ANGINA. TREATMENT IF ANY IS UNKNOWN. THE COMPLAINT RECEIVED STATES THAT (B)(4) STUDY PATIENT UNDERWENT CYPHER CORONARY STENT IMPLANTATION AND EXPERIENCED A PERI-PROCEDURAL MI, ANGINA AND INSTENT RESTENOSIS. THIS IS A (B)(6) MALE PATIENT WITH MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING ANGINA (WITHIN PAST 6 WEEKS), PREVIOUS PCI, PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI), PVD/CLAUDICATION, CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), SMOKING, AND HISTORY OF ALLERGY. THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS A DE NOVO LESION THAT OCCURRED PROXIMAL TO AN EXISTING CYPHER STENT, GRADED AS AN INSTENT RESTENOSIS. THE INDEX PROCEDURE THEN USED A 3.5 X 28MM CYPHER STENT THAT COVERED BOTH THE NEW LESION IN THE PROXIMAL RCA AND EXTENDED TO THE MID RCA. THE PREVIOUS STENT WAS PLACED IN THE MID RCA IN (B)(6) 2004. PATIENT'S POST PROCEDURE MEDICATIONS INCLUDED ASPIRIN, CLOPIDOGREL, AND BETA BLOCKERS. SIXTEEN TO TWENTY-FOUR HOURS POST PROCEDURE THE PATIENT HAD ELEVATED ENZYMES. PATIENT'S CK-MB PEAKED AT 30.6 (ULN 3.2). AT THE 30 DAY FOLLOW-UP AFTER THE PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT HAD STABLE ANGINA. APPROXIMATELY FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE THE PATIENT DIED. PATIENT'S CAUSE OF DEATH WAS END STAGE CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE AND HE DIED IN INPATIENT HOSPICE CARE. THE PATIENT'S COPD/DEATH WAS GRADED AS UNRELATED TO THE IMPLANTED CYPHER STENTS AND WILL BE CAPTURED AS A NON-COMPLAINT. THE (B)(6) HAS SINCE ADJUDICATED THAT THE ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES TO BE CONSIDERED AS A PERI-PROCEDURAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. (B)(4). A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. REVIEW OF LOT 15096801 REVEALED NO ANOMALIES DURING THE MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION PROCESSES THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. (B)(4). THE PRODUCT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE, NO EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS COULD BE PERFORMED. ADDITIONALLY, AS THE LOT NUMBER WAS NOT PROVIDED, A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLANTING CORONARY ARTERY STENTS. THE ACT OF ANGIOPLASTY INHERENTLY PRODUCES A LOCALIZED VESSEL INJURY, INCLUDING PLAQUE COMPRESSION AND SPLITTING, WHICH LEADS TO DAMAGED HEART CELLS AND THE RELEASE OF CARDIAC BIOMARKER ENZYMES INTO THE SYSTEMIC BLOODSTREAM. THIS ACTION (INHERENT RISK OF THE PROCEDURE) MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. IN-STENT RESTENOSIS IS A WELL-KNOWN POTENTIAL COMPLICATION FOR THIS TYPE OF PROCEDURE AND IS LISTED IN THE IFU. IN THE LITERATURE, IN-STENT STENOSIS RATES RANGE FROM 11% TO 39% FROM 6 TO 12 MONTHS AFTER STENT PLACEMENT. RATES WERE HIGHER IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH MORE SEVERE ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND DEPENDED ON THE TYPE OF STENOSIS TREATED. IN-STENT STENOSIS WAS MORE PREVALENT IN OSTIAL STENT PLACEMENT PROCEDURES. STENOSES IN STENTS ARE USUALLY TREATED WITH INTRASTENT PTA OR PLACEMENT OF A SECOND STENT. PROGRESSION OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE IS KNOWN TO CAUSE INSTENT RESTENOSIS AND DOES NOT INDICATE A DEVICE FAILURE. INTRA-ARTERIAL STENT PLACEMENT IS A TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE PROCESS AND IT NOT A PREVENTIVE OR CURE FOR THE PROGRESSION OF SYMPTOMS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC ARTERY DISEASE. ANGINA IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORONARY STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURE AND IS LISTED IN THE IFU AS SUCH. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF MANUFACTURING ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT; THEREFORE, NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED AT THIS TIME. THERE ARE PATIENT AND LESION CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENTS, SPECIFICALLY THE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE; I.E. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND SMOKING.

THE TARGET LESION WAS 3RD OM. VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 2.25MM AND LESION LENGTH WAS 10MM. LESION CLASSIFICATION WAS A. THE LESION WAS DE NOVO AND 90% STENOSED. THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED WITH A 2 X 12MM BALLOON AT 12ATM. THE STENT FAILED TO DELIVER THE FIRST ATTEMPT. IT WAS WITHDRAWN AND RETURNED TO THE STERILE FIELD. THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED AND THE (B)(4) WAS DEPLOYED AT 16ATM. POST-PROCEDURE STENOSIS WAS 0%. POST PROCEDURE THERE WERE ELEVATED CK AND TROPONIN LEVELS THAT WERE ADJUDICATED AS AN ARC EVENT AND ARE BEING CAPTURED AS AN MI. THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC TREATMENT GIVEN AND THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON DUAL ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY. APPROXIMATELY (B)(6) POST-PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT HAD STENT RESTENOSIS. THE EVENT WAS MEDICALLY MANAGED ONLY. THREE WEEKS LATER, THE PATIENT HAD A RIGHT BRACHIAL HEMATOMA POST-ANGIO. THE HEMATOMA WAS TREATED WITH ICE AND MANUAL PRESSURE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE FIRST SHEATH USED TO ACCESS THE RIGHT BRACHIAL ARTERY WAS A CORDIS J&J 6.5FR X 11CM. THIS SHEATH WAS IMMEDIATELY EXCHANGED FOR A SCIMED PINNACLE INTRO 6FR SHEATH. THE CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION CONTROL LOG REPORTS, "THIS SHEATH EXCHANGE WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE VASCULAR HEMOSTASIS." THE PATIENT ALSO REPORTED STABLE ANGINA AT THE 12 MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THE ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE NOTED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL PSEUDOANEURYSM THAT DID NOT REQUIRE TREATMENT. THE ADJUDICATION ALSO INDICATES THE STUDY STENT IN THE OM3 WAS TYPE 4 INSTENT RESTENOSIS PATTERN. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED INDICATING THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS POST INDEX PROCEDURE THE PATIENT HAD DIED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED PNEUMONIA, A CARDIAC ARREST IN THE NURSING HOME, AND EXPIRED. THE DEATH OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE. NO FURTHER INFORMATION COULD BE OBTAINED DESPITE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. THE STUDY STENT REMAINS IMPLANTED THUS UNAVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT.

THE PATIENT WAS ENROLLED IN THE (B)(4) STUDY. ON (B)(6) 2010, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT THE INDEX PROCEDURE WITH BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY AND PLACEMENT OF ONE STUDY (CXS33350/ LOT 1509904) STENT IN THE MID RCA AND A SECOND STENT (CXS33300/ LOT 15111599) IN THE DISTAL RCA. THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. POST PROCEDURE THE PATIENT'S TROPONIN L WAS ELEVATED. ON (B)(6) 2010; THE PATIENT RETURNED COMPLAINING OF ANGINA. ANGIOGRAPHY SHOWED A RESTENOSIS OF THE CYPHER STENT (CXS33350/ LOT 15099041) THAT WAS PLACED IN THE MID RCA. THE LESION WAS WITHIN 5MM OF THE CYPHER STENT IN THE DISTAL RCA AS THE STENTS WERE OVERLAPPING. THE RESTENOSIS WAS TREATED WITH A CUTTING BALLOON AND PLACEMENT OF A BARE-METAL STENT. (B)(4) ADJUDICATION MINUTES RECEIVED INDICATED THAT THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED MI APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN MONTHS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED FOR PRE-OPERATIVE EVALUATION FOR A REDO CABG SURGERY, WHICH WAS PLANNED ONE AND HALF WEEK LATER. THE PATIENT WAS ASYMPTOMATIC AT THAT TIME, BUT REFERRED TO INCREASED ASTHENIA OVER THE PREVIOUS FEW DAYS WITH NO COMPLAINTS OF CHEST PAIN OR SHORTNESS OF BREATH. THE SITE REPORTED THAT THE ECG REVEALED A COMPLETE HEART BLOCK. THE CKMB WAS 3.6 (NL 3.6) AND THE TROPONIN I WAS 0.288 (NL 0.045). THE ECG CORE LAB REPORTED PERSISTENT THIRD DEGREE AV BLOCK AND UNINTERPRETABLE MI DUE TO VENTRICULAR ESCAPE RHYTHM.

2136020|09/11/2011|IN|NIQ|THE COMPLAINT RECEIVED STATES THAT THIS (B)(4) STUDY PATIENT SUFFERED A STENT THROMBOSIS AND DIED POST INDEX PROCEDURE. THIS WAS AN (B)(6) MALE WITH MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING PREVIOUS PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION WITH CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERY (1995), HYPERTENSION, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS WITH RETINOPATHY, NEUROPATHY, OR NEPHROPATHY, MAJOR BLEEDING, SMOKING, ALLERGIES TO PENICILLIN, ENLARGED PROSTATE, AZOTEMIA, GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING, HEMORRHOIDECTOMY, DIVERTICULITIS, COLON RESECTION, PACEMAKER, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, GLAUCOMA, SKIN MELANOMA, CAD, DACRON AORTIC GRAFT, DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION, MELANOMA RIGHT SHOULDER, RECTAL BLEEDING SECONDARY TO RUPTURED DIVERTICULUM, AORTA REPLACEMENT, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE, SEVERE LV DYSFUNCTION, BI-VENTRICULAR ICD FOR HEART FAILURE THERAPY AND AN UNKNOWN STENT IN OBTUSE MARGINAL. THE PATIENT WAS AN ACTIVE SMOKER. THE TARGET LESIONS WERE LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA) AND DISTAL (RCA). THE PATIENT HAD NO ANGINA; THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS A PRE-PLANNED STAGED PROCEDURE TO TREAT BOTH TARGET LESIONS. IN (B)(6) 2010, THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS DONE. THE FIRST TARGET LESION WAS IN THE PROXIMAL RCA AND DESCRIBED AS DE NOVO, 80% STENOSED, 10MM IN LENGTH, NON-THROMBOSED, TYPE B1, WITH MILD CALCIFICATION. PRE-DILATION AND SINGLE STENT IMPLANTATION WERE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THE CORE LAB REPORTED 25% RESIDUAL STENOSIS, NO DISSECTION AND TIMI 3 FLOW. THE SECOND TARGET LESION WAS IN THE DISTAL RCA AND DESCRIBED AS DE NOVO, 90% STENOSED, 15MM IN LENGTH, NON-THROMBOSED, TYPE B1, WITH MILD CALCIFICATION. PRE-DILATION, SINGLE STENT IMPLANTATION AND POST-DILATION WERE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THE CORE LAB REPORTED A 21% RESIDUAL STENOSIS, NO DISSECTION AND TIMI 3 FLOW. ANGIOGRAPHY CONFIRMED A PATENT 3.0X8MM CYPHER STENT IN THE OM (IMPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2009) WITH MILD IN-STENT RE-NARROWING BUT NO SIGNIFICANT STENOSIS. THE POST PROCEDURE COURSE WAS UNCOMPLICATED AND THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED THE FOLLOWING DAY ON DUAL ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY. IN (B)(6) 2011, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND WEAKNESS. THE SITE REPORTED A NON-Q WAVE MI AND HEART FAILURE. ON (B)(6) 2011, THE TROPONIN WAS 2.25, NO CK OR CKMB WERE TESTED. THE ECG CORE LAB REPORTED A PACED RHYTHM. ECHOCARDIOGRAM REVEALED ANTERIOR APICAL AND INFERIOR WALL AKINESIS, MODERATE TO SEVERE MR AND AN EF OF 25%. ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED PATENT STUDY STENTS IN THE RCA, TOTAL 100% OCCLUSION OF THE MID LAD WITH COLLATERAL CIRCULATION FROM THE RCA, A 100% TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE LAD GRAFT, OCCLUDED GRAFT TO THE LCX AND A PATENT STENT IN THE LCX. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT WAS CONTINUED. THE MI HAS BEEN CAPTURED AS A NON-COMPLAINT. IN (B)(6) 2011, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT IMPLANTATION OF A BIV-ICD (BI-VENTRICULAR IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER/DEFIBRILLATOR). THIS WAS IMPLANTED FOR CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION AND TREATMENT OF CHF. ON (B)(6) 2011, THE FOLLOW UP VISIT FOR THE ICD WAS UNEVENTFUL. ON (B)(6) 2011, THE PATIENT DIED. THE SITE REPORTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE. THE CEC ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE HAS DEEMED THIS EVENT A POSSIBLE STENT THROMBOSIS, THUS THE FILE WAS UPDATED WITH A CODE FOR MI. NO AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED. THE CYPHER STENTS REMAIN IMPLANTED THUS UNAVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. (B)(4), THE DHR REVIEW WAS EXTENDED TO THE STENT COATING SITE. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT NO NONCONFORMANCES WERE ISSUED DURING THE COATING PROCESS, AND THAT NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND FOR THE LOT INVOLVED. (B)(4), THE DHR REVIEW WAS EXTENDED TO THE STENT COATING SITE. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT NO NONCONFORMANCES WERE ISSUED DURING THE COATING PROCESS, AND THAT NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND FOR THE LOT INVOLVED.

REVIEW OF LOT 15069542 REVEALED NO ANOMALIES DURING THE MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION PROCESSES THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. LATE THROMBOSIS IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG ELUTING STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURES AND IS LISTED IN THE IFU AS SUCH. THE ACT OF STENT IMPLANTATION PRODUCES INTENDED DAMAGE TO THE INTIMA OF THE VESSEL WALL IN ORDER TO REMODEL THE WALL AND REESTABLISH PATENCY OF THE VESSEL. THE DISRUPTION OF THE INTIMAL LAYERS TRIGGERS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO HEAL THE DAMAGED AREAS, THUS ACTIVATING THE CLOTTING MECHANISM AS WELL AS THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. THE COMBINATION OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND CLOTTING CASCADE CAN LEAD TO THROMBUS FORMATION IN SIDE OF THE STENT AROUND THE DAMAGED AREAS. ELUTED DRUGS INHIBIT EPITHELIALIZATION IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT RESTENOSIS. DUAL ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY IS USED TO ASSIST IN THE PREVENTION OF THROMBUS ON THE INSIDE OF THE STENT, SECONDARY TO PLATELETS ATTACHING TO THE DISTURBED INTIMAL LAYERS AND METAL STENT STRUTS POST STENT IMPLANTATION.

PRE-DILATION AND SINGLE STENT IMPLANTATION WERE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THE CORE LAB REPORTED 25% RESIDUAL STENOSIS, NO DISSECTION AND TIMI 3 FLOW. THE SECOND TARGET LESION WAS IN THE DISTAL RCA AND DESCRIBED AS DE NOVO, 90% STENOSED, 15MM IN LENGTH, NON-THROMBOSED, TYPE B1, WITH MILD CALCIFICATION. PRE-DILATION, SINGLE STENT IMPLANTATION AND POST-DILATION WERE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THE CORE LAB REPORTED A 21% RESIDUAL STENOSIS, NO DISSECTION AND TIMI 3 FLOW. ANGIOGRAPHY CONFIRMED A PATENT 3.0X8MM CYPHER STENT IN THE OM (IMPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2009) WITH MILD IN-STENT RE-NARROWING, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT STENOSIS. THE POST PROCEDURE COURSE WAS UNCOMPLICATED AND THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED THE FOLLOWING DAY ON DUAL ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY. IN (B)(6) 2011, THE PATIENT COMPLAINED OF SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND WEAKNESS. THE SITE REPORTED A NON-Q WAVE MI AND HEART FAILURE. ON 5/23/2011 THE TROPONIN WAS 2.25, NO CK OR CKMB WERE TESTED. THE ECG CORE LAB REPORTED A PACED RHYTHM. ECHOCARDIOGRAM REVEALED ANTERIOR APICAL AND INFERIOR WALL AKINESIS, MODERATE TO SEVERE MR AND AN EF OF 25%. ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED PATENT STUDY STENTS IN THE RCA, TOTAL 100% OCCLUSION OF THE MID LAD WITH COLLATERAL CIRCULATION FROM THE RCA, A 100% TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE LAD GRAFT, OCCLUDED GRAFT TO THE LCX AND A PATENT STENT IN THE LCX. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT WAS CONTINUED. THE MI HAS BEEN CAPTURED AS A NON-COMPLAINT. IN (B)(6) 2011, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT IMPLANTATION OF A BIV-ICD (BI-VENTRICULAR IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER/DEFIBRILLATOR). THIS WAS IMPLANTED FOR CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION AND TREATMENT OF CHF. ON (B)(6) 2011, THE FOLLOW UP VISIT FOR THE ICD WAS UNEVENTFUL. ON (B)(6) 2011 THE PATIENT DIED. THE SITE REPORTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE. THE CEC ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE HAS DEEMED THIS EVENT A POSSIBLE STENT THROMBOSIS, THUS THE FILE WAS UPDATED WITH A CODE FOR MI. NO AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED. THE CYPHER STENTS REMAIN IMPLANTED THUS UNAVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. THE DHR REVIEW WAS EXTENDED TO THE STENT COATING SITE. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT NO NONCONFORMANCES WERE ISSUED DURING THE COATING PROCESS, AND THAT NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND FOR THE LOT INVOLVED. LATE THROMBOSIS IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG ELUTING STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURES AND IS LISTED IN THE IFU AS SUCH. THE ACT OF STENT IMPLANTATION PRODUCES INTENDED DAMAGE TO THE INTIMA OF THE VESSEL WALL IN ORDER TO REMODEL THE WALL AND REESTABLISH PATENCY OF THE VESSEL. THE DISRUPTION OF THE INTIMAL LAYERS TRIGGERS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO HEAL THE DAMAGED AREAS, THUS ACTIVATING THE CLOTTING MECHANISM AS WELL AS THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. THE COMBINATION OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND CLOTTING CASCADE CAN LEAD TO THROMBUS FORMATION IN SIDE OF THE STENT AROUND THE DAMAGED AREAS. ELUTED DRUGS INHIBIT EPITHELIALIZATION IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT RESTENOSIS. DUAL ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY IS USED TO ASSIST IN THE PREVENTION OF THROMBUS ON THE INSIDE OF THE STENT, SECONDARY TO PLATELETS ATTACHING TO THE DISTURBED INTIMAL LAYERS AND METAL STENT STRUTS POST STENT IMPLANTATION.

2261313|02/18/2010|IN|NIQ|THE COMPLAINT RECEIVED STATES THAT (B)(4) STUDY PATIENT SUFFERED CARDIAC ENZYME ELEVATION AND CORONARY ARTERY STENOSIS DURING THE PERI-INDEX PROCEDURE PHASE. THIS IS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING ANGINA, STABLE ANGINA PECTORIS, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, HYPERTENSION, COPD, DIABETES MELLITUS II, PRESENT SMOKER, DIVERTICULOSIS, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, CHRONIC ANXIETY AND ANEMIA, GASTRO-ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE. THE PATIENT WAS ENROLLED IN (B)(4) STUDY WITH A 90%, DE NOVO, BIFURCATED, TYPE B2 LESION IN THE PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY. THE LESION WAS 22MM IN LENGTH AND THE VESSEL WAS 2.75MM IN DIAMETER. THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED AND A 2.75 X 33MM CYPHER STENT WAS IMPLANTED AT 10ATM. CORONARY SIDE BRANCH OCCLUSION, DURING THE INDEX PROCEDURE, WAS NOTED. ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD SLIGHTLY ELEVATED TROPONIN LEVELS 16-24 HOURS POST PROCEDURE. APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AND SIX MONTHS POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED A LARGE CEREBRAL FRONTAL PARENCHYMAL HEMORRHAGE WITH EXTENSION INTO VENTRICLES AND WAS MEDICALLY TREATED. HOWEVER, THE PATIENT DIED. THIS EVENT WAS DEEMED TO BE UNRELATED TO THE DEVICE IMPLANTED AT INDEX AND WILL BE CAPTURED AS A NON-COMPLAINT. THE INDEX STENT REMAINS IMPLANTED THUS UNAVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS.

REVIEW OF LOT 15065136 REVEALED NO ANOMALIES DURING THE MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION PROCESSES THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. SIDE BRANCH OCCLUSION IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURES. THE INHERENT ACTION INVOLVED IN THE STENT IMPLANTATION PROCESS INCLUDES RADIAL AND OUTWARD FORCES THAT SHIFT THE EXISTING PLAQUE; UNFORTUNATELY THIS PLAQUE SHIFT CAN OCCLUDE SIDE BRANCHES THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN PROXIMITY OF THE TARGET LESION. ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES ARE A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURES AND IS LISTED IN THE IFU AS SUCH. THE ACT OF ANGIOPLASTY/STENT IMPLANTATION INHERENTLY PRODUCES A LOCALIZED VESSEL INJURY, INCLUDING PLAQUE COMPRESSION AND SPLITTING, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO RELEASE OF ATHEROMATOUS MATERIAL (LESION CONTENTS) INTO THE DOWNSTREAM FLOW AND POTENTIALLY SLOWING OR COMPLETELY OCCLUDING THE BLOOD FLOW. THE INFLATION OF CORONARY DEVICES ALSO INHERENTLY OCCLUDES THE DISTAL BLOOD FLOW, POSSIBLY CREATING ISCHEMIC AREAS (CAUSING CARDIAC ENZYME CHANGES) DISTAL TO THE TARGET LESION. THIS ACTION (INHERENT RISK OF THE PROCEDURE) COMBINED WITH THE PATIENT'S COMPLEX MEDICAL STATUS, VESSEL CHARACTERISTICS AND PROCEDURAL FACTORS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. ALL PRODUCTS UNDERGO A 100% INSPECTION PRIOR TO RELEASE FOR MARKETING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF MANUFACTURING ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT; THEREFORE, NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.
2284099|05/15/2011|IN|NIQ|AMENDED CC TO INCLUDE STENT FRACTURE. AN (B)(6) FEMALE WITH UNKNOWN MEDICAL HISTORY EXPERIENCED CARDIAC ARREST AND DECEASED APPROXIMATELY SIX YEARS POST IMPLANTATION OF FIVE CYPHER STENTS. THE TARGET LESION WAS PROXIMAL TO DISTAL RCA AND THE PROXIMAL TO MID LAD (AHA1~3, 6 AND 6-7). THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL RCA LESION WAS A CHRONIC TOTAL OCCLUSION, BUT THERE IS NO FURTHER LESION INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THERE IS NO LESION INFORMATION REGARDING THE LAD. DURING THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THREE CYPHER STENTS (SIZES AND LOT NUMBERS UNKNOWN) WERE IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL RCA. THERE IS NO FURTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE REGARDING THIS PROCEDURE. TWO DAYS LATER, PCI WAS CONDUCTED TO TREAT THE PROXIMAL TO MID LAD. THE 4TH CYPHER (SIZE AND LOT UNKNOWN) WAS IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL LAD AND THE 5TH CYPHER (SIZE AND LOT UNKNOWN) WAS IMPLANTED IN THE MID LAD. THERE IS NO FURTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE REGARDING THIS PROCEDURE. MEDICATIONS PRESCRIBED AT DISCHARGE WERE UNKNOWN. APPROXIMATELY SIX YEARS LATER, PCI WAS CONDUCTED TO TREAT A LESION IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX (AHA 11) WITH THE IMPLANTATION OF A NON-CORDIS DES (NOBORI: 2.75/18MM). IT WAS UNKNOWN IF THE NEW LESION IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WAS WITHIN 5MM OF THE CYPHER STENT IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL LAD. THE PATENCY OF THE CYPHER STENTS AT THIS PROCEDURE WAS UNKNOWN BUT NO RE-PCI IN THE TARGET LESIONS WAS REPORTED. FOUR DAYS AFTER THIS PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND THEN DIED DUE TO CARDIAC ARREST AT MIDNIGHT. THE PATIENT HAD BEEN INFECTED WITH MRSA AND MRSA SEPSIS. ISCHEMIC ELECTROCARDIOGRAM CHANGES OR ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES WERE NOT OBSERVED. AN AUTOPSY WAS CONDUCTED AND NO THROMBUS WAS OBSERVED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED INDICATED THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE PATIENT'S INDEX PROCEDURE WAS DUE TO AN ACUTE ANTEROSEPTAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI). BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED AT THIS TIME TO THE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD TARGET LESION. NO TARGET LESION INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. FIVE (5) YEARS LATER, THE PATIENT HAD A RE-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (RE-PCI) DUE TO AN ACUTE INFERIOR WALL MI. A 2.75 X 18 MM BARE METAL STENT (BMS) WAS IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA) TARGET LESION. THE PROXIMAL RCA TARGET LESION WAS REPORTED TO BE: DE NOVO, AND A 99% STENOSIS. THE RESIDUAL STENOSIS POST-PROCEDURE WAS 0%. BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY (POBA) WAS PERFORMED TO THE POSTEROLATERAL BRANCH DURING THIS PROCEDURE. THE POSTEROLATERAL BRANCH TARGET LESION WAS REPORTED TO BE A DE NOVO LESION. APPROXIMATELY SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE PATIENT'S INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED CHEST PAIN DURING HEMODIALYSIS AND CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMED. THE PATIENT HAD A TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL RCA. A TOTAL OF THREE (3) CYPHER STENTS WERE IMPLANTED: A 3.0 X 23 MM, A 3.0 X 18 MM, AND A 2.5 X 23 MM. THE RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. NO FURTHER PROCEDURAL INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. TWO DAYS LATER, THE PATIENT HAD A PCI TO THE PROXIMAL AND MID LAD TARGET LESIONS. TWO (2) ADDITIONAL CYPHER STENTS WERE IMPLANTED: A 3.0 X 18 MM (CYPHER STENT #4), AND A 2.5 X 18 MM CYPHER STENT #5). THE POST-PROCEDURE RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. NO FURTHER PROCEDURAL INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. APPROXIMATELY TWELVE YEARS AFTER THE PATIENT'S INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT WAS REPORTED TO BE EXPERIENCING RECURRENT HEART FAILURE AND ALSO THAT DURING HEMODIALYSIS EXPERIENCED DECREASED BLOOD PRESSURE. THE PATIENT'S LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION (LVEF)/FUNCTION WAS REPORTED TO BE REDUCED AT THIS TIME FROM 60% TO 40%. CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS RECOMMENDED AT THIS TIME BUT THE FAMILY DECLINED. APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PATIENT'S INDEX PROCEDURE, CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMED AND THREE-VESSEL DISEASE WAS IDENTIFIED. TWO TARGET LESIONS WERE TREATED. A XIENCE 2.5 DRUG-ELUTING STENT (DES) WAS IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. THE LESION WAS POST-DILATED AND THE RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. A XIENCE 2.5 X 8 MM STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE MID LAD TARGET LESION. THE LESION WAS POST-DILATED AND THE RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. SIX DAYS LATER, CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMED AND A 75% RESTENOSIS OF THE CYPHER STENT IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL RCA AND A 90% RESTENOSIS OF THE CYPHER STENT IN THE DISTAL RCA WAS NOTED. THE RESTENOTIC LESIONS WERE TREATED BY BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY (POBA) INCLUDING A CUTTING BALLOON. IVUS WAS ATTEMPTED BUT WAS UNABLE TO BE ADVANCED TO THE DISTAL RCA DUE TO FLEXION. IVUS OF THE PROXIMAL RCA INDICATED THAT THE CYPHER 3.0 X 23 MM STENT IN THE PROXIMAL RCA WAS FRACTURED. AFTER BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY, A XIENCE 3.0 X 15 MM STENT WAS IMPLANTED INSIDE THE CYPHER STENT IN THE PROXIMAL RCA. THE STENT WAS POST-DILATED AND IVUS WAS PERFORMED. THE STENT WALL APPOSITION WAS CONFIRMED BY IVUS. APPROXIMATELY TWO AND ONE-HALF MONTHS AFTER THE LAST PCI, THE PATIENT HAD SURGERY DUE TO OCCLUSION OF THE HEMODIALYSIS SHUNT IN THE LEFT ARM. THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED LOSS OF APPETITE AFTER THE SURGERY. TWO DAYS AFTER THE SURGERY, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED SHOCK AND DECREASED CONSCIOUSNESS ((B)(6) COMA SCALE 300). THE PATIENT RESPONDED TO VERBAL STIMULATION AFTER REHYDRATION THERAPY BUT WAS NOTED TO HAVE ST-SEGMENT DEPRESSION IN THE PERCORDIAL LEADS OVER A BROAD AREA OF MYOCARDIUM. NITROGLYCERIN WAS ADMINISTERED WITHOUT EFFECT. FOUR HOURS LATER THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED SHOCK AGAIN WHICH IMPROVED BUT ECG CHANGES AND CHEST PAIN CONTINUED. TWO HOURS LATER, WHILE BEING TRANSPORTED TO THE CCU UNIT, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED SHOCK AGAIN AND CARDIAC ENZYME ELEVATION. THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AN INFERIOR WALL AMI. CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS DONE AND A 100% STENOSIS OF THE STENTS IN THE PROXIMAL RCA WAS NOTED AND OCCLUSION OF THE CONUS BRANCH. THE XIENCE STENT IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WAS 100% OCCLUDED. THE PATIENT DEVELOPED SHOCK AGAIN AND AN INTRA AORTIC BALLOON PUMP (IABP) WAS INSERTED. THE PATIENT WAS INTUBATED. THE PATIENT DEVELOPED A JUNCTIONAL HEART RHYTHM AND A TEMPORARY PACEMAKER WAS INSERTED. BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY OF THE PROXIMAL RCA WAS DONE A 50% RESIDUAL STENOSIS WITH TIMI 3 FLOW WAS NOTED. THE PHYSICIAN WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE POSTEROLATERAL BRANCH WITH A GUIDEWIRE. THERE WAS NO COLLATERAL CIRCULATION NOTED BETWEEN THE RCA AND PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. THE PHYSICIAN WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX LESION WITH A GUIDEWIRE DESPITE USING A MICROCATHETER. THE BLOOD FLOW WAS NOTED TO BE IMPROVED DUE TO COLLATERAL CIRCULATION BETWEEN THE LAD AND CIRCUMFLEX. NO FURTHER TREATMENT TO THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WAS ATTEMPTED. A SWAN GANZ CATHETER WAS INSERTED AND THE PATIENT TRANSPORTED TO CCU. THE CAUSE OF THE SHOCK EXPERIENCED BY THE PATIENT WAS SAID TO BE DUE TO TWO-VESSEL DISEASE/OCCLUSION. TWO DAYS LATER, THE PATIENT'S HEMODYNAMICS HAD IMPROVED AND THE IABP WAS REMOVED. THREE DAYS AFTER REMOVAL OF THE IABP, CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WAS DONE AND A 25% RESTENOSIS OF THE PROXIMAL RCA, A 50% STENOSIS OF THE MID RCA, A 99% OCCLUSION OF THE ARTERIOVENTRICULAR BRANCH, A 90% OCCLUSION OF THE POSTERIOR DESCENDING BRANCH, AND TOTAL OCCLUSION OF THE XIENCE STENT IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX WAS NOTED. THE PATIENT'S LVEF WAS 33.1%. THE PATIENT WAS NOTED TO HAVE GRADE FOUR (4) MITRAL REGURGITATION. TWO DAYS LATER, THE PATIENT HAD ANOTHER RE-PCI. A NOBORI 2.75 X 18 MM STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE PROXIMAL CIRCUMFLEX. THE RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. FLUID REMOVAL FROM THE PATIENT WAS PERFORMED TO WEAN THE PATIENT FROM THE VENTILATOR. THE DAY AFTER THE LAST RE-PCI, THE PATIENT HAD A FEVER OF 39° C. (B)(6) WAS DETECTED BY BLOOD CULTURE AND VEGETATION WAS NOTED ON THE TRICUSPID VALVE BY ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY WAS STARTED. DURING THE NIGHT THE PATIENT DEVELOPED SHOCK/BREATHING DIFFICULTY. BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND FLUID REPLACEMENT THERAPY WAS CONDUCTED. DOPAMINE/DOBUTAMINE WERE ADMINISTERED FOR BLOOD PRESSURE SUPPORT. THE PATIENT WAS HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE. TWO DAYS LATER, A CT SCAN WAS DONE AND CONFIRMED HYPOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY. THE PATIENT EXPIRED THE NEXT DAY. AN AUTOPSY WAS CONDUCTED AND NO THROMBUS WAS OBSERVED. THE PHYSICIAN'S COMMENT WAS THAT THE EVENT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE NOBORI STENT. THE PRODUCTS REMAIN IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT AND ARE THUS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER. STENT FRACTURE, RESTENOSIS, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND DEATH ARE POTENTIAL EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY ARTERY STENTING. WHILE NOT OBSERVED IN THE PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS THAT SUPPORTED THE CYPHER STENT PMA, STENT FRACTURES ARE UNCOMMON EVENTS BUT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN LONG STENTED SEGMENTS INCLUDING THOSE IN WHICH OVERLAPPING STENTS HAVE BEEN USED. THEY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN CORONARY SEGMENTS THAT UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT MOTION, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WITH SEVERE ANGULATION, TORTUOSITY AND CALCIFICATION. IN THE CYPHER STENT, THEY HAVE BEEN REPORTED MOST OFTEN IN CERTAIN LESION SUBGROUPS IN WHICH SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. RECENTLY, SES FRACTURE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A NEW POTENTIAL MECHANISM OF RESTENOSIS. POSSIBLE DISPOSING FACTORS OF STENT FRACTURE ARE LONG LESIONS WITH OVERLAPPING STENTS AND CORONARY SEGMENTS THAT UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT MOTION, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WITH SEVERE ANGULATION, TORTUOSITY AND CALCIFICATION. REVIEW OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE PATIENT FACTORS (ADVANCED AGE, EXTENSIVE CAD, EF 33%, MITRAL REGURGITATION, MRSA COMPLICATION) AND POSSIBLE VESSEL CHARACTERISTICS (LONG LESION) THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENTS. WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER TO CONDUCT A DHR REVIEW, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE IF THE REPORTED FAILURE COULD BE RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THEREFORE NO CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN AT THIS TIME.

2303867|10/13/2011|IN|NIQ|UPDATED COMPLAINT CONCLUSION: THE COMPLAINT RECEIVED STATES THAT THIS CYPRESS STUDY PATIENT SUFFERED UNSTABLE ANGINA AND A NON-STEMI APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS POST INDEX PROCEDURE THEN SUBSEQUENTLY DIED OF END STAGE CORONARY DISEASE. THIS IS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING MI ((B)(6) 2010), ANGINA, PREVIOUS PCI ((B)(6) 2008), PREVIOUS SINGLE VESSEL CABG ((B)(6) 2006), BRACHYTHERAPY, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, HYPERTENSION, MILD LV DYSFUNCTION (EF 4- - 50%), INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES, ANXIETY/DEPRESSION, PSUEDOSEIZURES, ASTHMA, GERD, HIATAL HERNIA, GASTRITIS AND ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. THE PATIENT ALSO HAS MIDRIN, PROTONIX, ADENOSINE, LODINE, PERCOCET, VICODAN, DEMEROL, DARVOCET, CIPRO, TAMIFLU AND IMATREX ALLERGIES. IN (B)(6) 2010, THE INDEX PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED WITH THE INDICATION OF UNSTABLE ANGINA; HOWEVER, THE FUNCTIONAL STRESS TEST WAS NORMAL. THE PATIENT WAS ON AN ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX MEDICATION REGIMEN, STATINS, BETA- AND ACE INHIBITORS PERI-PROCEDURE. ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED TRIPLE VESSEL DISEASE. ONE TARGET LESION IN THE SVG (SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT) TO THE LAD WAS TREATED IN THE INDEX PROCEDURE. THE TARGET LESION WAS DESCRIBED AS IN-STENT RESTENOSIS OF AN UNKNOWN STENT. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED THE FOLLOWING DAY WITH NO ANGINA REPORTED. ONE CYPHER RX 2.5 X 8MM STENT WAS DIRECTLY IMPLANTED AND POST DILATED WITHOUT REPORT OF DIFFICULTY. AT THE 30 DAY FOLLOW UP ((B)(6) 2010) NO ANGINA WAS REPORTED AND DUAL ANTIPLATELET MEDICATION WAS ONGOING. AT THE 6 MONTH FOLLOW UP ((B)(6) 2010) NO ANGINA WAS REPORTED AND DUAL ANTIPLATELET MEDICATION WAS ONGOING. AT THE 12 MONTH FOLLOW UP ((B)(6) 3/2011) DUAL ANTI-PLATELET REGIMEN WAS ONGOING, NO ANGINA WAS REPORTED BUT AN ADVERSE EVENT WAS REPORTED. NO FURTHER INFORMATION HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO DATE REGARDING THIS EVENT. AT THE 15 MONTH FOLLOW UP ((B)(6) 2011) DUAL ANTI-PLATELET REGIMEN WAS ONGOING, NO ANGINA WAS REPORTED BUT AN ADVERSE EVENT WAS REPORTED. FURTHER INFORMATION RECEIVED STATES THAT THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH ANGINA, AND A NEW LESION IN THE 1ST RPL WAS TREATED SUCCESSFULLY WITH AN UNKNOWN DES. THE EVENT WAS NOTED TO BE UNRELATED TO THE INDEX PROCEDURE AND INDEX STENT IMPLANTED IN A VEIN GRAFT TO THE DISTAL LAD. AT THE 18 MONTH FOLLOW UP ((B)(6) 2011) THE PATIENT WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH UNSTABLE ANGINA AND NON-STEMI WAS REPORTED. CARDIAC BIOMARKERS WERE NOTED TO BE ELEVATED. NO ANGIOGRAPHY WAS PERFORMED, AS THE PATIENT HAS A HISTORY OF FALSE POSITIVE STRESS TESTS, FALSE POSITIVE TROPONIN LEVELS, AND CHRONIC CHEST PAIN SYNDROME. HOWEVER, A FULL CARDIAC WORKUP WAS DONE ON THIS PATIENT, WITH NOTHING FOUND. THE PHYSICIAN HAS DETERMINED THAT THE NSTEMI WAS SECONDARY TO RESPIRATORY FAILURE AND HYPOTENSION AND UNRELATED TO THE INDEX PROCEDURE AND IMPLANTED STENT. THE NSTEMI WAS MEDICALLY MANAGED ONLY, AND THE PATIENT WAS SENT HOME WITH HOSPICE AFTER MI MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED THAT REPORTED IN (B)(6) 2011 THE PATIENT DIED. THE DEATH CERTIFICATE REPORTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS END STAGE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND UNCONTROLLED DIABETES. THE PATIENT'S FAMILY REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT REMAINED AT HOME ON HOSPICE CARE; HOWEVER, A FEW DAYS BEFORE HER DEATH, SHE WENT INTO A COMA. THE INDEX STENT REMAINS IMPLANTED THUS UNAVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. REVIEW OF LOT 15096797 REVEALED NO ANOMALIES DURING THE MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION PROCESSES THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. CHEST PAIN IS KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURES AND IS LISTED IN THE CYPHER IFU AS SUCH. INTRA-ARTERIAL STENT PLACEMENT IS A TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE PROCESS AND IT NOT A PREVENTIVE OR CURE FOR THE PROGRESSION OF SYMPTOMS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC ARTERY DISEASE. THE NATURAL PROGRESSION OF CORONARY DISEASE AS WELL AS TARGET LESION ISSUES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE EXPERIENCE OF CHEST PAIN / ANGINA. MI IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH CORONARY STENT IMPLANTATION AND IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THROMBOTIC OR RESTENOSIS EVENTS WHEREIN THE INNER LUMEN OF THE CORONARY ARTERY BECOMES NARROWED AND BLOOD FLOW DECREASED. THE MYOCARDIAL TISSUES ARE STARVED OF OXYGEN AND OTHER NUTRIENTS SECONDARY TO THE DECREASED OR STOPPED BLOOD FLOW AND IT CAUSES PERMANENT CARDIAC DAMAGE. INTRA-ARTERIAL STENT PLACEMENT IS A TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE PROCESS AND IT NOT A PREVENTIVE OR CURE FOR THE PROGRESSION OF SYMPTOMS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC ARTERY DISEASE.

IN THIS CASE THERE ARE NO FOLLOW UP ANGIOGRAPHY IMAGES TO POSITIVELY ASSOCIATE THE REPORTED EVENTS WITH THE INDEX STENT OR PROCEDURE. REVIEW OF THE INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT VESSEL, LESION AND PATIENT FACTORS, SPECIFICALLY THE COMPLICATED CONCOMITENT MEDICAL HISTORY MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENTS.
2327193|03/21/2011|IN|NIQ|(B)(4) TRIAL. IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THROMBOSIS AND PATIENT DEATH OCCURRED. THE PATIENT PRESENTED AT THE TIME OF THE INDEX PROCEDURE DUE TO A POSITIVE STRESS TEST AND A PRIOR ANGIOGRAM WHICH REVEALED SIGNIFICANT MULTIVESSEL DISEASE. THE PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED SUPPORTED BY A LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE DUE TO CARDIOMYOPATHY. THE FIRST LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL TO MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY (LAD). THE FIRST DIAGONAL WAS REPORTED TO HAVE 99% STENOSIS IN THE MID SECTION. THIS TARGET LESION WAS IN STENT RESTENOSIS OF A PREVIOUS UNKNOWN BARE METAL STENT IMPLANTED IN 2009. A 3.0X38MM TAXUS LIBERTE STENT WAS ADVANCED AND DEPLOYED TO COVER THE LAD AND FIRST DIAGONAL LESION WITH NO NOTED ISSUES. THE SECOND LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE 90-99% STENOSED FIRST OBTUSE MARGINAL (OM1) AT THE TAKEOFF FROM THE LEFT CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY (LCX). THIS TARGET LESION WAS IN STENT RESTENOSIS OF A PREVIOUS UNKNOWN BARE METAL STENT IMPLANTED IN 2009. A 2.5X12MM PROMUS STENT WAS ADVANCED BUT WAS UNABLE TO CROSS THE LESION. IT WAS REMOVED, AND A SECOND 2.5X12MM PROMUS STENT WAS ADVANCED AND SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED IN THE OM1 WITH NO NOTED ISSUES. THE POST OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS WAS SUCCESSFUL REVASCULARIZATION OF THE MID LAD AND OM1. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED THE NEXT DAY ON ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX. (B)(6) 2011: THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED DUE TO CHEST PAIN AND DIAGNOSED AS HAVING A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI). CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION REVEALED THROMBUS WITHIN THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED TAXUS LIBERTE IN THE LAD. THERE WAS NO ISSUE AT THAT TIME WITH THE PROMUS IN THE OM1. ANGIOJET ASPIRATION WAS PERFORMED. THE PATIENT DEVELOPED HEART BLOCK. OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY (OCT) WAS PERFORMED REVEALING EVIDENCE OF IMPROVED BUT PERSISTANT LUMINAL THROMBUS. A 3.0X15MM NON-BSC BARE METAL STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE LAD TO TREAT THE THROMBUS. REPEAT OCT REVEALED IMPROVED LUMINAL PATENCY AND RESOLUTION OF THE THROMBUS. FINAL ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED TIMI-3 FLOW, GOOD STENT EXPANSION AND NO RESIDUAL DISSECTION OR PERFORATION. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED 3 DAYS AFTER BEING ADMITTED. (B)(6) 2011: THE PATIENT HAD A CARDIOLOGY VISIT WHERE IT WAS NOTED THAT THE (B)(6) 2011 THROMBOSIS WAS DUE TO MEDICATION NON-COMPLIANCE, BUT THAT THE PATIENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOLD TO STOP HIS PLAVIX DUE TO A FISTULA REPLACEMENT. FIVE DAYS FOLLOWING THIS VISIT, THE PATIENT DIED AT AN OUTSIDE FACILITY DURING DIALYSIS TREATMENT. IT IS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT DIED DUE TO A CEREBRAL VASCULAR ACCIDENT AND CARDIAC ARREST.

2766482|02/06/2012|IN|NIQ|COMPLAINT CONCLUSION: AS REPORTED BY MEDICAL AFFAIRS, THE DAUGHTER OF A PATIENT CALLED TO REPORT THAT ON (B)(6) 2012, THE PATIENT DIED AS A RESULT OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. THIS WAS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDING CAD. THE PATIENT WAS NOT HOSPITALIZED. IN (B)(6) 2003, THE PATIENT HAD CYPHER STENT IMPLANTED TO AN UNKNOWN ARTERY DUE TO BLOCKAGE. THE PATIENT DIED AS A RESULT OF CAD APPROXIMATELY 9 YEARS POST INDEX PROCEDURE. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS KNOWN. THE CYPHER STENT REMAINS IMPLANTED THUS UNAVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. REVIEW OF LOT X0603932 REVEALED NO ANOMALIES DURING THE MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION PROCESSES THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. DEATH, FROM ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE, IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORONARY STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURES AND IS LISTED IN THE IFU (INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE) AS SUCH. ALL PRODUCTS UNDERGO A 100% INSPECTION PRIOR TO RELEASE FOR MARKETING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF MANUFACTURING ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT; THEREFORE, NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED AT THIS TIME. INTRA-ARTERIAL STENT PLACEMENT IS A TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE PROCESS AND IT NOT A PREVENTIVE OR CURE FOR THE PROGRESSION OF SYMPTOMS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC ARTERY DISEASE. REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION DOES NOT ALLOW FOR AN EXACT DETERMINATION OF CAUSAL FACTORS; HOWEVER, THE PATIENT WAS OF ADVANCED AGE WITH KNOWN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED DEATH.
2770096|09/22/2012|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT ON (B)(6) 2012 THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI) AND FELT CHEST PAIN. REPORTEDLY, THE PHYSICIAN PERFORMED CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION IN THE TARGET LESION, RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA), AND THE DIAGNOSIS IN THE RCA SHOWED THE PATIENT'S BLOOD FLOW WAS SLOW. A 2.75X15 TREK DILATATION CATHETER WAS ADVANCED AND PRE-DILATATION WAS PERFORMED IN THE POSTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (PDA). A 2.75X18 RX XIENCE PRIME STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM (SDS) WAS ADVANCED TO THE DISTAL PDA, IMPLANTED AND BLOOD FLOW IN THE RCA WAS STILL SLOW. REPORTEDLY, THE PHYSICIAN FELT THERE WAS SOME ACUTE THROMBUS IN THE RCA BUT COULD NOT CONFIRM AND NO TREATMENT WAS PERFORMED. A 3.0X28 RX XIENCE PRIME SDS WAS ADVANCED AND IMPLANTED IN THE RCA MID TO THE PDA ACROSS FROM THE POSTERIOR LATERAL ARTERY AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO BLOOD FLOW AND THE PATIENT WENT INTO SHOCK. CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION WAS PERFORMED FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES, ISOKET WAS ADMINISTERED AND THE PATIENT WAS STABLE AND TRANSFERRED TO CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY TO PERFORM CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT (CABG). AFTER CABG WAS PERFORMED THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. REPORTEDLY, THAT EVENING THE PATIENT OUTCOME WAS BAD AND THE FAMILY DID NOT AGREE TO THE USE OF EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE OXYGENATION AND THE PATIENT DIED. REPORTEDLY, THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS AMI WITH CARDIOGENIC SHOCK. NO AUTOPSY WILL BE PERFORMED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.
2808541|01/01/2010|IN|NIQ|PATIENT HAD ONE ENDEAVOR DRUG-ELUTING STENT IMPLANTED IN THE LCX DURING A STAGED PROCEDURE. A DISSECTION IS REPORTED TO HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE PROCEDURE AND AN ADDITIONAL ENDEAVOR DRUG-ELUTING STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE LCX TO TREAT THE COMPLICATION. APPROXIMATELY 47 MONTHS POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT DIED. THE DEATH WAS ASSESSED AS A NON-CARDIAC DEATH (DEPRESSION AND ANOREXIA). THE INVESTIGATOR ASSESSED THAT THE EVENT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE STUDY STENT.
2810116|08/09/2012|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST CORONARY STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THROMBOSIS, SHOCK, CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST AND DEATH OCCURRED. IN (B)(6) 2012, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED THE CHEST PAIN. THROMBOTIC OCCLUSION IN THE RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA), A 90% STENOSED LESION IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERY, AND TOTAL OCCLUSION AT THE LEFT CIRCUMFLEX (LCX) ARTERY WERE CONFIRMED. THEY ADVANCED THE GUIDEWIRE AND THROMBECTOMY CATHETER BUT NEITHER DEVICE WOULD CROSS THE LESION. THEY DILATED THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL RCA WITH A 2.5 MM × 12 MM BALLOON CATHETER AT 6ATM AND TRIED TO ADVANCE A 3.0 MM × 38 MM NON-BSC STENT, BUT WERE UNABLE TO GET THIS STENT TO CROSS THE LESION. THEY SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED THREE DIFFERENT STENTS IN THE PROXIMAL TO DISTAL RCA. THE FIRST WAS A 3.0 MM ×12 MM NON-BSC STENT, THE SECOND WAS A 3.0 MM × 15 MM NON-BSC STENT, AND THE THIRD WAS A 3.0 MM × 12 MM PROMUS ELEMENT STENT. THE THREE STENTS WERE DEPLOYED IN AN OVER-LAPPING MANNER WITH A FINAL RESULT OF 0% STENOSIS AND A TIMI FLOW OF 3. THEY DID NOT TREAT THE LAD OR LCX. IN (B)(6) 2012, INFECTION OCCURRED. LAB RESULTS WERE CRP 30MG/DL AND 28000 WHITE BLOOD CELLS /L BY A BLOOD TEST. SIX DAYS LATER, LAB RESULTS WERE CRP 14MG/DL AND 14000 WHITE BLOOD CELLS /L BY A BLOOD TEST. THE PATIENT SEEMED TO HAVE NO ENERGY, SO A PCI WAS PERFORMED WHICH REVEALED THROMBOSIS AT THE DISTAL END OF THE 3.0 MM × 12 MM PROMUS ELEMENT TO THE DISTAL RCA. AFTER THAT, ATRIOVENTRICULAR BLOCK, SHOCK, AND CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST OCCURRED; BRAIN WAVES WERE FLAT. THE PHYSICIAN PERFORMED INTRA-AORTIC BALLOON PUMP AND INSERTED THE PERCUTANEOUS CARDIOPULMONARY SUPPORT DEVICE INTO THE PATIENT. THE FOLLOWING DAY, PCI WAS PERFORMED AND THEY DILATED THE THREE STENTS IN THE RCA USING TWO BALLOON CATHETERS (1.2 MM X 6 MM AND A 2.5 MM × 15 MM). POST-DILATION, PERFUSION (FLOW) WAS CONFIRMED. IN ADDITION, THEY USED THE SAME TWO BALLOON CATHETERS TO DILATE THE 90% STENOSIS IN THE LAD AND ATTEMPTED TO PLACE THREE STENTS (TWO NON-BSC STENTS AND ONE PROMUS ELEMENT STENT), HOWEVER, NONE OF THE STENTS WOULD CROSS THE LESION AND THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED. NINE DAYS LATER, THE PATIENT EXPIRED. THE PHYSICIAN STATED THAT THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE DEATH WAS EITHER ATRIOVENTRICULAR BLOCK OR THROMBOSIS.
2845814|10/19/2012|IN|NIQ|SUBSEQUENT TO THE PREVIOUSLY FILED REPORT, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED INDICATING THAT THE ENZYME ELEVATION WAS CONSIDERED A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION BASED ON THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM AND ENZYME LEVELS. APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS LATER, ON (B)(6) 2013, THE PATIENT EXPIRED DUE TO SEPTIC SHOCK; HOWEVER, THE SEPSIS WAS DEEMED UNRELATED TO THE STUDY DEVICE/PROCEDURE.

IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST A CORONARY STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED RESTENOSIS, THROMBOSIS AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION THE DE NOVO TARGET LESION BEING TREATED WAS LOCATED IN THE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). THE LESION WAS 80% STENOSED, 3.0MM IN DIAMETER AND 28MM LONG. THE LESION WAS TREATED WITH DIRECT STENT PLACEMENT USING A 3.0X38MM ION STENT. RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON ASPIRIN AND CLOPIDOGREL. IN (B)(6) 2012, THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED AND FOUND TO HAVE NON-OCCLUSIVE THROMBUS IN THE LEFT PROFUNDA. MEDICATION WAS GIVEN AND AORTOGRAM WITH BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY RUNOFF, STENTING TO RIGHT EXTERNAL AND COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES WAS PERFORMED TO TREAT THE EVENT. THE EVENT WAS CONSIDERED RESOLVED WITHOUT RESIDUAL EFFECTS AND THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON THE SAME DAY. LATER, IN (B)(6) 2012, THE PATIENT HAD ELEVATED CARDIAC ENZYMES AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WAS REPORTED (PEAK CK= 6483 IU/L, ULN= 240 IU/L; PEAK CK-MB= 579.9 IU/L, ULN= 7.5 IU/L; PEAK TROPONIN I= 386.62 NG/ML, ULN= 0.29 NG/ML). CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION WAS RECOMMENDED. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED ISCHEMIC SYMPTOMS. A 100% TOTAL OCCLUSION, STENT THROMBOSIS, RESTENOSIS OF THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED STUDY STENT LOCATED IN THE MID RCA WAS TREATED WITH ASPIRATING THROMBECTOMY, BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY AND PLACEMENT OF A BARE METAL STENT. MEDICATION WAS GIVEN TO TREAT THE EVENT. THE EVENTS WERE CONSIDERED RESOLVED WITHOUT RESIDUAL EFFECTS. LATER THAT DAY THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL AND WAS SEEN TO HAVE ACUTE OCCLUSION OF THE RIGHT COMMON ILIAC. RIGHT LEG AMPUTATION ABOVE KNEE, REVISION OF ABOVE KNEE AMPUTATION WITH GUILLOTINE AMPUTATION WAS PERFORMED TO TREAT THE EVENT. EIGHT DAYS LATER THE PATIENT DIED. THE CAUSE OF DEATH IS ACUTE OCCLUSION OF THE RIGHT COMMON ILIAC ARTERY. PER THE PHYSICIAN, THE DEATH IS NOT RELATED TO THE ION STENT.

A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH STENT IMPLANTATION PROCEDURES AND IS LISTED IN THE IFU AS SUCH. THE ACT OF ANGIOPLASTY/STENT IMPLANTATION INHERENTLY PRODUCES A LOCALIZED VESSEL INJURY, INCLUDING PLAQUE COMPRESSION AND SPLITTING, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO RELEASE OF ATHEROMATOUS MATERIAL (LESION CONTENTS) INTO THE DOWNSTREAM FLOW AND POTENTIALLY SLOWING OR COMPLETELY OCCLUDING THE BLOOD FLOW. THE INFLATION OF CORONARY DEVICES ALSO INHERENTLY OCCLUDES THE DISTAL BLOOD FLOW, POSSIBLY CREATING ISCHEMIC AREAS (CAUSING CARDIAC ENZYME CHANGES) DISTAL TO THE TARGET LESION. ALL PRODUCTS UNDERGO A 100% INSPECTION PRIOR TO RELEASE FOR MARKETING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF MANUFACTURING ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT; THEREFORE, NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.

2936014|01/01/2003|IN|NIQ|(B)(4). DURING PROCESSING OF THIS COMPLAINT, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO OBTAIN COMPLETE EVENT, PATIENT AND DEVICE INFORMATION. PROCEDURAL SUCCESS WAS DEFINED AS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RESIDUAL IN-STENT STENOSIS OF LESS THAN 30%, ASSOCIATED WITH THROMBOLYSIS IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (TIMI) 2-3 FLOW WITHOUT THE OCCURRENCE OF DEATH, MI, OR REPEAT TARGET LESION REVASCULARIZATION DURING THE INDEX HOSPITALIZATION. POST PROCEDURAL MI WAS DEFINED AS CREATINE KINASE MB FRACTION (CK-MB) INCREASE GREATER THAN 3 TIMES THE UPPER LIMIT OF NORMAL IF BASELINE CK-MB WAS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS AND 50% INCREASE OVER BASELINE IF BASELINE CK-MB WAS ELEVATED. RESULTS: OUT OF 342 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY INTERVENTION (PTCI) PROCEDURES BETWEEN THE DATES OF JANUARY 2003 AND MAY 2010, CORONARY ANGIOGRAMS AND PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES FOR 109 PATIENTS WHO SPECIFICALLY UNDERWENT 113 OSTIAL SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT (SVG) PTCI (STENTING) PROCEDURES WERE REVIEWED; ONE PATIENT OUT OF THE 109 PATIENTS EXPERIENCED A STROKE AND SUBSEQUENTLY EXPIRED. IN ADDITION TO THE STROKE, PATIENTS EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING RELEVANT ADVERSE EVENTS (POTENTIALLY RELATED TO UNSPECIFIED XIENCE V STENTS): TWO PATIENTS DEVELOPED STENT THROMBOSIS. ONE PATIENT HAD ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. IN ONE PROCEDURE, A RETRIEVAL FILTER WAS UNABLE TO CROSS THROUGH A 3.5X15 XIENCE V STENT TO RETRIEVE THE FILTER, AND, ONE HOUR LATER, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED CHEST PAIN AND ACUTE STENT THROMBOSIS CAUSING CARDIAC ARREST WHILE IN THE RECOVERY ROOM; AFTER CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) WAS PERFORMED, THE PATIENT WAS TREATED VIA REPEAT STENT IMPLANTATION USING TWO UNSPECIFIED BARE METAL STENTS (3.0X28 AND 3.5X28 STENTS). ONE PATIENT DEVELOPED DISTAL EMBOLIZATION AND NO RE-FLOW; PCI WAS PERFORMED. ONE PATIENT EXPERIENCED A VESSEL DISSECTION WHICH WAS TREATED VIA MULTIPLE BALLOON INFLATIONS; 33% OF 20 PATIENTS EXPERIENCED A MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI); 5 OF THOSE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONS OCCURRED PERIPROCEDURE. THE MAIN FINDING OF THIS STUDY IS THAT EPDS CAN BE UTILIZED IN THE MAJORITY OF OSTIAL SVG LESIONS, BUT IN 11% OF CASES FILTER RETRIEVAL CAN BE CHALLENGING AND MAY RARELY (IN APPROXIMATELY 1%) LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATION. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. (B)(4). THERE WERE NO REPORTED PRODUCT DEFICIENCIES. THE REPORTED PATIENT EFFECTS OF ANGINA, DISSECTION, THROMBOSIS, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT/STROKE, EMBOLISM, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, OCCLUSION, RENAL FAILURE, ADDITIONAL THERAPY/NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT, AND HOSPITALIZATION ARE LISTED IN THE XIENCE V/XIENCE NANO EVEROLIMUS ELUTING CORONARY STENT SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) AS KNOWN ADVERSE EVENTS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE DEVICES WERE IMPLANTED TO TREAT OSTIAL SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT (SVG) LESIONS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE IFU STATES: XIENCE V IS INDICATED FOR IMPROVING CORONARY LUMINAL DIAMETER IN PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC HEART DISEASE DUE TO DE NOVO (NEW) NATIVE CORONARY ARTERY LESIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE IFU STATES: SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE XIENCE V STENT IMPLANT HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR SUBJECT POPULATIONS WITH LESIONS LOCATED IN SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFTS. ALTHOUGH A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED PATIENT EFFECTS AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEVICE, IF ANY, CANNOT BE DETERMINED, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY DEFICIENCY WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURE, DESIGN, OR LABELING.

2946336|01/08/2013|M|NIQ|SAME CASE MDR ID: 2134265-2013-00436. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION PROCEDURE, STENT DAMAGE OCCURRED. THE 95% STENOSED TARGET LESION BEING TREATED WAS LOCATED IN THE MODERATELY TORTUOUS AND SEVERELY CALCIFIED SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT (SVG) TO THE OBTUSE MARGINAL (OM) ARTERY. THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH A 2.00 X 12 MM APEX BALLOON CATHETER TO 12 ATMOSPHERES. A 2.50 X 16 MM PROMUS ELEMENT PLUS STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM (SDS) WAS THEN ADVANCED BUT COULD NOT CROSS THE LESION, THE SDS WAS READY TO BE REMOVED WHEN IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PROXIMAL END OF THE STENT WAS FLARED. THE SDS, GUIDE CATHETER AND NON-BSC GUIDE WIRE WERE ALL REMOVED. A NON-BSC GUIDE CATHETER WAS THEN ADVANCED AND ABLE TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THE OM VIA THE NATIVE LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY, THE SAME NON-BSC GUIDE WIRE WAS THEN ADVANCED TO THE OM. THE SAME 2.00 X 12 MM APEX BALLOON CATHETER WAS THEN ADVANCED BUT COULD NOT CROSS THE LESION. A 1.20 X 12 MM NON-BSC BALLOON CATHETER WAS THEN ADVANCED AND WAS ALSO UNABLE TO CROSS THE LESION. A 1.50 X 12 MM APEX PUSH BALLOON CATHETER WAS THEN ADVANCED AND WAS ABLE TO CROSS HALF OF THE LESION. THE 1.50 X 12 MM APEX PUSH BALLOON WAS INFLATED. A 1.20 X MM NON-BSC BALLOON WAS THEN ADVANCED TO THE LESION AND AT THIS TIME THE PATIENT CODED. ALL OF THE DEVICES WERE REMOVED FROM THE PATIENT AND CHEST COMPRESSIONS AND BALLOON PUMP WERE USED TO STABILIZE THE PATIENT, HOWEVER THE PATIENT EXPIRED. IN THE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN, THE PATIENT'S SMALL MARGINAL BRANCH WAS SUPPORTING THE HEART AND WHEN INTERVENTION OF THE BRANCH WAS UNSUCCESSFUL THE PATIENT COULD NOT RECOVER. IT IS THE OPINION OF THE PHYSICIAN THAT THE BSC DEVICES WERE NOT RELATED TO THE PATIENT DEATH.
2948731|05/30/2012|IN|NIQ|(B)(6) CLINICAL STUDY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT FOLLOWING A CORONARY ARTERY STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED AN ARRHYTHMIA. THE TARGET LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE DISTAL LEFT CIRCUMFLEX WITH 70% STENOSIS AND WAS 12 MM LONG WITH A REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER OF 4.0 MM. THE PHYSICIAN TREATED THE LESION WITH PRE-DILATATION AND PLACEMENT OF A 4.00 X 16 MM STUDY STENT. FOLLOWING POST DILATATION, RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0%. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON ASPIRIN AND CLOPIDOGREL. IN (B)(6) 2012, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH COMPLAINTS OF "BURNING DYSESTHETIC PAIN WRAPPING FROM THE BACK TO THE FRONT LIKE ANT BITES." THERE WERE SIGNS OF ATROPHY IN THE CERVICAL AND THORACIC MUSCULATURE THAT WAS NOTED. A CHEST X-RAY REVEALED NO ACUTE PROCESS. AN ECG REVEALED AN EJECTION FRACTION OF 55-65%. MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST REVEALED NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL CHANGES. MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST REVEALED MULTILEVEL DEGENERATIVE CHANGES. MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST REVEALED SMALL FOCUS OF SIGNAL ABNORMALITY INVOLVING THE SUPERIOR ENDPLATE OF T8 MEASURING 1 CM WAS OBSERVED AND AN ABNORMAL FOCUS OF SIGNAL INVOLVING THE RIGHT LOBE LIVER WAS NOTED. CHEST X-RAY REVEALED MULTIPLE MASSES INVOLVING THE LIVER WITH ASSOCIATED PANCREATIC MASS AND LEFT ADRENAL MASS CONCERNING FOR NEOPLASM, SCLEROTIC FOCUS INVOLVING THE UPPER THORACIC VERTEBRAL BODY AT THE T5 REGION AND BIBASILAR ATELECTASIS VERSUS SCARRING WITH INTERSTITIAL THICKENING INVOLVING THE LATERAL SEGMENT OF THE RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE OF THE LUNG WAS NOTED. CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST REVEALED PANCREATIC TAIL MASS MEASURING 3 X 2 CM WITH MULTIPLE MASSES INVOLVING THE LIVER AND LEFT ADRENAL MASS REPRESENTING PRIMARY PANCREATIC NEOPLASM WITH A METASTATIC DISEASE TO THE LEFT ADRENAL GLAND AND LIVER. THE LIVER MASS TISSUE WAS BIOPSIED. BIOPSY RESULTS REVEALED MARKEDLY ATYPICAL GLANDULAR PROLIFERATION FAVORING ADENOCARCINOMA. FIVE (5) DAYS LATER THE PATIENT EXPIRED. THE CAUSE OF DEATH HAS BEEN REPORTED AS MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. AS PER THE DEATH CERTIFICATE, THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS "ARRYTHMIA" AND THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF DEATH WAS "METASTATIC PANCREATIC CANCER". NO AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED.
2961269|09/24/2012|IN|NIQ|DURING INDEX PROCEDURE THE PATIENT HAD TWO ENDEAVOR SPRINT DRUG ELUTING STENTS IMPLANTED IN THE LAD.

3034820|02/28/2013|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A STENTING TREATMENT PROCEDURE STENT DAMAGED OCCURRED AND FIVE DAYS LATER THE PATIENT EXPIRED. ACCESS WAS OBTAINED VIA THE RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY. THE 80% STENOSED TARGET LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE SEVERELY TORTUOUS AND MODERATELY CALCIFIED, ECCENTRIC AND DE NOVO LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY (LAD) WHICH HAD A BEND BETWEEN 45 - 90 DEGREES. ROTATIONAL ABLATION WAS PERFORMED IN THE OSTIAL AND MID LAD WITH A 1.75MM BUR, TWICE AT 120.000 RPM AND ONCE AT 150.000 RPM. AFTERWARDS, THE MID TO DISTAL LAD WAS PREDILATED WITH A 2.5X15MM BALLOON AND A 2.5X16MM PROMUS ELEMENT STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE MID TO DISTAL LAD AT 14ATMS FOR 15 SECONDS, A 3.0X18MM NON BSC STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE MID LAD AT 16ATMS FOR 25 SECONDS AND A 3.5X12MM PROMUS ELEMENT STENT WAS IMPLANTED IN THE OSTIAL LAD AT AN UNKNOWN PRESSURE FOR 20 SECONDS. POST DILATION WAS PERFORMED WITH A 3.5X10MM NC BALLOON AT 14ATMS IN THE MID LAD AND AT 18ATMS IN THE OSTIAL LAD. A "STRANGE IMAGE" WAS NOTED ON ANGIOGRAPHY AFTER THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE 3.5X12MM PROMUS ELEMENT STENT IN THE OSTIAL LESION. IVUS WAS PERFORMED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A STENT STRUT OF THE 3.5X12MM PROMUS ELEMENT STENT WAS DAMAGED; HOWEVER, IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE WAS NO DISSECTION AND THE DAMAGED STRUT DID NOT COMPROMISE FLOW. THE 3.5X10MM NC BALLOON WAS INFLATED AT 6ATMS IN THE AREA OF THE STENT STRUT DAMAGE. GOOD APPOSITION AND EXPANSION OF THE STENT WERE VERIFIED WITH IVUS. IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE WAS A GOOD FINAL RESULT IN THE LESION WITH TIMI 3 FLOW. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED AND THE PATIENT'S CONDITION FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE WAS GOOD. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PATIENT REMAINED AT THE HOSPITAL DUE TO OTHER CONCOMITANT DISEASES AND THE PATIENT PASSED AWAY FIVE DAYS LATER. THE PATIENT'S CAUSE OF DEATH WAS DUE TO A LARGE THROMBUS IN THE ILIAC ARTERY. THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PATIENT'S DEATH IS RELATED TO THE STENTING PROCEDURE OR THE PROMUS ELEMENT STENTS THAT WERE IMPLANTED IN THE LAD.
3059865|03/13/2013|M|NIQ|SAME CASE AS MFR ID # 2134265-2013-02325. IT WAS REPORTED THAT PRIOR TO A PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION, A SHAFT BREAK OCCURRED. THE TARGET LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE PROXIMAL RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). THE LESION WAS PRE-DILATED WITH AN UNKNOWN BALLOON, AND PRIOR TO STENT IMPLANT THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED STEMI AND THROMBOSIS. AS THE 2.5X24MM PROMUS ELEMENT PLUS STENT WAS PREPPED FOR USE THE PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO REMOVE THE STYLET WIRE FROM THE DEVICE, THE PHYSICIAN BENT THE CATHETER SHAFT AND THE SHAFT BROKE NEAR THE PROXIMAL END OF THE STENT. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH A 3.0X24MM PROMUS ELEMENT PLUS STENT. ONE HOUR FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE THE PATIENT EXPIRED DUE TO HEART ARRHYTHMIA. THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT FEEL THAT THE IMPLANTED STENT WAS A CONTRIBUTOR TO PATIENT DEATH.
3061517|03/21/2013|IN|MAF|IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PROCEDURE WAS TO TREAT A PERFORATION OF A SAPHENOUS VEIN GRAFT TO THE RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY. AN UNKNOWN DEVICE CAUSED A PERFORATION AND A NON-ABBOTT STENT WAS USED IN AN ATTEMPT TO SEAL THE PERFORATION. IT WAS DECIDED TO TAKE THE PATIENT TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR OPEN HEART SURGERY; HOWEVER, WHILE WAITING FOR THE OPERATING ROOM, IT WAS DECIDED TO TRY TO SEAL THE PERFORATION WITH A 3.5 X 16 MM GRAFTMASTER. THE GRAFTMASTER COULD NOT CROSS THE LESION SO THE PATIENT WAS TAKEN TO SURGERY WITHOUT SEALING THE PERFORATION. TWELVE HOURS POST SURGERY, THE PATIENT EXPIRED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.

THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH CLASS 1, NON-Q WAVE NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (B)(6) 2011 AND CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION WAS PERFORMED REVEALING 1 TARGET LESION. THE DE NOVO AND 100% STENOSED TARGET LESION WAS LOCATED IN THE MID LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) ARTERY WITH A REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER OF 3.00MM AND A LESION LENGTH OF 26MM. THE LESION WAS PREDILATED WITH AN UNSPECIFIED BALLOON AND 3.00X28MM TAXUS LIBERTE STENT WAS DEPLOYED, RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. FOLLOWING STUDY STENT PLACEMENT, SLOW FLOW OCCURRED WHICH WAS TREATED WITH MULTIPLE INJECTIONS OF FRESH BLOOD AND 500 MCG OF ADENOSINE OVER THE COURSE OF 15-20 MINUTES UNTIL FLOW WAS RESTORED. IN ADDITION, A NON-TARGET LESION LOCATED IN THE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY WAS TREATED WITH DIRECT STENT PLACEMENT USING A 3.00X15MM PROMUS STENT, RESULTING IN 0% RESIDUAL STENOSIS. TWO DAYS LATER, THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED ON ASPIRIN AND PRASUGREL. IN (B)(6) 2013 THE PATIENT PRESENT WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH. ECG REVEALED NORMAL SINUS RHYTHM AND LEFT AXIS DEVIATION AND TROPONIN WAS FOUND TO BE ELEVATED. THE SUBJECT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RESPIRATORY FAILURE, HYPERKALEMIA, AND NON Q-WAVE NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND WAS HOSPITALIZED ON THE SAME DAY. RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST SHOWED ¿MARKEDLY PROGRESSED PATCHY BILATERAL LUNG AIRSPACE NODULAR DENSITIES¿. THE PATIENT WAS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT AND HENCE, AGREED TO QUIT AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT AND PROCEED WITH PALLIATIVE CARE INSTEAD. CHEST X-RAY REVEALED VERY EXTENSIVE ¿LARGE CANNONBALLS IN THE LUNGS¿. THE PATIENT HAD BEEN ON RADIATION TREATMENT FOR ENDOMETRIAL CANCER. THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON BIPAP AND OXYGEN. AFTER INITIAL RESPONSE, THE PATIENT DETERIORATED AND HAD WORSENING HYPERCAPNIA AND HYPOXEMIA. THE FOLLOWING DAY RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST SHOWED ¿UNCHANGED CARDIOMEGALY, MODERATE LEFT LUNG BASE CONSOLIDATION/ EFFUSION AND INNUMERABLE HAZY LUNG NODULARITY.¿ THE FOLLOWING DAY RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST SHOWED ¿UNCHANGED CARDIOMEGALY WITH A TRACH, MODERATE LEFT LUNG BASE CONSOLIDATION/ EFFUSION AND INNUMERABLE HAZY LUNG NODULES UNIMPROVED.

3464238|01/01/2001|IN|MAF|OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE OUR 18-YEAR EXPERIENCE OF DUCTAL STENTING (DS) IN INFANTS WITH A DUCT-DEPENDENT PULMONARY CIRCULATION. THE SECONDARY AIM SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY A SUBGROUP OF PATIENTS WHO MAY BENEFIT THE MOST USING THIS EVOLVING TECHNIQUE. METHODS: BETWEEN 1991 AND 2009, 65 NEONATES AND INFANTS (39 MALE, 60%) UNDERWENT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION FOR DS IN 3 PARTICIPATING CENTRES. PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO WHETHER DS WAS ATTEMPTED BETWEEN 1991-2000 (GROUP 1, N520) OR BETWEEN 2001-2009 (GROUP 2, N545). RESULTS: DS WAS SUCCESSFUL IN 52/65 (80%) PATIENTS. DS OUTCOME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DUCTAL MORPHOLOGY AND CARDIAC DIAGNOSIS. DS FAILED MORE OFTEN IN PATIENTS WITH UNIVENTRICULAR PHYSIOLOGY AND TORTUOUS DUCT MORPHOLOGY (P < 0.001). MOST PATIENTS UNDERGOING DS IN GROUP 2 HAD PULMONARY ATRESIA WITH INTACT VENTRICULAR SEPTUM (PAIVS)(P < 0.001). DS WAS SUCCESSFUL IN 94% OF THESE PATIENTS. GROUPS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY IN DIAMETER AND LENGTH OF FIRST IMPLANTED STENT (P < 0.001), IMPLANTING ADDITIONAL STENT (P < 0.001), AND OCCURRENCE OF COMPLICATIONS (P50.033). FREEDOM FROM RE-INTERVENTION FOR THE 52 PATIENTS WAS 92.3%. NO PROCEDURE-RELATED MORTALITY OCCURRED. TWO MULTI-LINK ZETA STENTS WERE DEPLOYED IN TWO DIFFERENT PATIENTS IN GROUP 2 CONSISTING OF 45 PATIENTS, 37 OF WHICH UNDERWENT SUCCESSFUL DUCTAL STENTING. ONE PATIENT UNDERWENT STENT REDILATATION. TWENTY-THREE PATIENTS NEEDED NO FURTHER PROCEDURES, OF THE 23 1 PATIENT DIED; HOWEVER, CAUSE OF DEATH WAS PULMONARY ATRESIA WITH INTACT VENTRICULAR SEPTUM. ONE PATIENT UNDERWENT SURGERY. TWELVE PATIENTS ARE AWAITING SURGERY.
3492484|03/31/2010|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN (B)(6) 2009, 2 PROMUS STENTS WERE DEPLOYED (3.5X28 MM AND 2.5X12 MM) IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY AND THE 1ST DIAGONAL RESPECTIVELY. ON (B)(6) 2009, ANOTHER PROMUS STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE OBTUSE MARGINAL. ON (B)(6) 2010, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT REVASCULARIZATION OF THE LAD AND DIAGONAL WITH 2 ADDITIONAL PROMUS STENTS. ON (B)(6) 2013, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH POORLY AROUSABLE WITH HYPOTENSION AND WAS REHOSPITALIZED. THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SEPTIC SHOCK, ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. DURING THE COURSE OF HOSPITALIZATION, THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON A MECHANICAL VENTILATOR AND WAS TREATED WITH INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, VESOPRESSORS, BRONCHODILATORS, AND IV ANTIBIOTICS. ON (B)(6) 2013, THE PATIENT HAD EPISODES OF CARDIAC ARREST AND HAD BRADYCARDIA. THE PATIENT WAS FOUND TO BE WITHOUT AUDIBLE HEART TONES AND NO RESPIRATORY EFFORT WAS NOTED. THE PATIENT EXPIRED ON (B)(6) 2013. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS NOTED TO BE SEPTIC SHOCK NOT RELATED TO THE DEVICES OR THE PROCEDURE.
3492522|03/31/2010|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN (B)(6) 2009, 2 PROMUS STENTS WERE DEPLOYED (3.5X28 MM AND 2.5X12 MM) IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY AND THE 1ST DIAGONAL RESPECTIVELY. ON (B)(6) 2009, ANOTHER PROMUS STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE OBTUSE MARGINAL. ON (B)(6) 2010, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT REVASCULARIZATION OF THE LAD AND DIAGONAL WITH 2 ADDITIONAL PROMUS STENTS. ON (B)(6) 2013, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH POORLY AROUSABLE WITH HYPOTENSION AND WAS REHOSPITALIZED. THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SEPTIC SHOCK, ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. DURING THE COURSE OF HOSPITALIZATION, THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON A MECHANICAL VENTILATOR AND WAS TREATED WITH INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, VESOPRESSORS, BRONCHODILATORS, AND IV ANTIBIOTICS. ON (B)(6) 2013, THE PATIENT HAD EPISODES OF CARDIAC ARREST AND HAD BRADYCARDIA. THE PATIENT WAS FOUND TO BE WITHOUT AUDIBLE HEART TONES AND NO RESPIRATORY EFFORT WAS NOTED. THE PATIENT EXPIRED ON (B)(6) 2013. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS NOTED TO BE SEPTIC SHOCK NOT RELATED TO THE DEVICES OR THE PROCEDURE.
3493128|09/04/2009|IN|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD A 3.5 X 18 MM PROMUS STENT IMPLANTED INTO THE MID RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY (RCA). AFTER THE STENT WAS IMPLANTED, A VASOSPASM AT THE DISTAL EDGE OF THE STENT WAS VISIBLE. NITROGLYCERIN WAS ADMINISTERED. IN ADDITION, A SERIOUS INJURY WAS REPORTED AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE PROMUS STENT WAS NOT CLARIFIED. IT WAS FURTHER REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT DIED ON (B)(6) 2013 DUE TO PANCREATIC CANCER, NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE PROMUS STENT. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.
3516842|11/18/2013|M|NIQ|IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED TO USE A 2.25MM DIAMETER X 24MM LENGTH ENDEAVOR RESOLUTE (RX) DRUG-ELUTING STENT TO TREAT A TARGET LESION LOCATED IN THE CX ARTERY, WHICH HAD A SEVERE DEGREE OF CALCIFICATION WITH MODERATE VESSEL TORTUOSITY WITH 90% STENOSIS. THE DEVICE WAS PREPPED AS PER IFU WITH NO ABNORMALITIES NOTED. A PRE-DILATION BALLOON WAS USED AND INFLATED 3 TIMES TO A MAXIMUM OF 20 ATMS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT RESISTANCE WAS FELT DURING LESION PENETRATION BUT NO FORCE WAS USED TO DELIVER THE DEVICE ACROSS THE LESION. WHEN THE DEVICE WAS PULLED BACK FROM THE PATIENT, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE STENT WAS DAMAGED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT EXPIRED (DATE AND CAUSE OF DEATH UNKNOWN), HOWEVER IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT DEATH NOT RELATED TO THE STENT. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DEVICE (ENDEAVOR RESOLUTE) IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRIBUTED PRODUCT (RESOLUTE INTEGRITY).
3527937|11/21/2013|M|NIQ|THREE STENTS WERE DEPLOYED DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE FIRST STENT , A RESOLUTE INTEGRITY 3.00 X 38 MM DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE RCA VESSEL SUCCESSFULLY. THE SECOND STENT A RESOLUTE INTEGRITY 2.25 X 22 MM WAS ALSO REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY. THE THIRD STENT USED WAS AN ENDEAVOR RESOLUTE 3.00 X 38 MM DRUG ELUTING STENT WHICH WAS TO BE USED TO TREAT A PROXIMAL LESION OF THE LAD. THE STENT WAS PREPPED PER THE IFU PRIOR TO USE. THE STENT WAS INFLATED ONCE TO 14 ATM AND THE STENT WAS DEPLOYED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DEFLATION OF THE BALLOON TOOK A LONGER TIME THAN NORMAL. DURING AN ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE DEVICE FROM THE LAD, DIFFICULTIES WERE ENCOUNTERED AND THE PATIENT WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST. FORCE WAS APPLIED IN AN ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE DEVICE, ONLY THE WIRE WAS REMOVED, THE STENT AND BALLOON REMAINED IN THE LAD. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PHYSICIAN THEN ATTEMPTED TO SNARE THE BALLOON DURING WHICH TIME THE PATIENT EXPIRED. CINE IMAGE REVIEW: THE PATIENT¿S RCA WAS INITIALLY TREATED WITHOUT PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS. THERE WAS DIFFUSE DISEASE IN THE LEFT CORONARY SYSTEM. PRE-DILATATION OF THE LESION IN THE LAD WAS COMPLETED WITH RESISTANCE DISEASE EVIDENT DUE TO THE WAIST THAT WAS EVIDENT IN THE INFLATED BALLOON. THE ENDEAVOR RESOLUTE LONG STENT WAS DELIVERED AND INFLATED FOR STENT DEPLOYMENT. THE WAIST EVIDENT DURING RE-DILATATION WAS ALSO EVIDENT IN THE MID TO DISTAL SECTION OF THE STENT. IT APPEARS THAT THE WAIST IN THE NEWLY DEPLOYED STENT, WHICH WAS AS RESULT OF THE SEVERE DISEASE, PREVENTED THE SUCCESSFUL WITHDRAWAL OF THE DELIVERY CATHETER. DESPITE REPEATED UNSUCCESSFUL WITHDRAWAL ATTEMPTS, INCLUDING USE OF A SNARE, THE DISTAL PORTION OF THE CATHETER DETACHED AND REMAINED IN THE VESSEL. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DEVICE (ENDEAVOR RESOLUTE) IS DISTRIBUTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; HOWEVER, IT IS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRIBUTED PRODUCT (RESOLUTE INTEGRITY).
3564050|11/01/2012|IN|NIQ|ONE ENDEAVOR DRUG ELUTING STENT WAS USED TO TREAT THE LAD DURING THE INDEX PROCEDURE. IT IS REPORTED THAT APPROXIMATELY 36 MONTHS POST INDEX PROCEDURE THE PATIENT SUFFERED A STROKE AND SUBSEQUENTLY EXPIRED. INVESTIGATOR INDICATED THAT THE EVENT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE STUDY DEVICE.
3579156|02/28/2013|IN|NIQ|IT WAS FURTHER REPORTED THAT IN (B)(6) 2013, THE PATIENT ALSO PRESENTED WITH CHEST PAIN. THE DISSECTION OCCURRED IN THE DISTAL LAD. THE PHYSICIAN CONSIDERED THAT AN UNKNOWN GUIDEWIRE CAUSED VESSEL DISSECTION AND IT WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE 3.50X38MM PROMUS ELEMENT¿ PLUS STENT. ONE DAY POST INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY TO TREAT THE VENTRICULAR SEPTAL PERFORATION. IT TOOK TIME TO STOP THE BLEEDING FROM THE VENTRICULAR APEX DURING THE PROCEDURE. POST PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED HYPOTENSION AND HYPOXIA. PERCUTANEOUS CARDIOPULMONARY SUPPORT (PCPS) AND TRANSFUSION WERE PERFORMED. THE PATIENT EXPIRED ONE DAY POST INDEX PROCEDURE INSTEAD OF 10 DAYS AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. THE PHYSICIAN THOUGHT THAT THE VENTRICULAR SEPTAL PERFORATION OCCURRED AS COMPLICATION OF ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION AND IT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE STUDY STENT.
3601033|01/06/2013|IN|NIQ|(B)(4). THERE WAS NO REPORTED DEVICE MALFUNCTION AND THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED. THE REPORTED PATIENT EFFECTS OF ANGINA, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, OCCLUSION, AND THROMBOSIS ARE KNOWN OBSERVED AND POTENTIAL PATIENT EFFECTS AS LISTED IN THE PROMUS EVEROLIMUS ELUTING CORONARY STENT SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). ALTHOUGH A CONCLUSIVE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED PATIENT EFFECTS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PRODUCT, IF ANY, CANNOT BE DETERMINED, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY DEFICIENCY WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING, DESIGN OR LABELING.

COMPLAINT CONCLUSION: AS NOTED IN THE PUBLICATION BY TEPE ET AL DRUG-ELUTING STENTS VERSUS PTA WITH GP IIB/IIA BLOCKAGE BELOW THE KNEE IN PATIENTS WITH CURRENT ULCERS - THE BELOW STUDY, THE JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY 51 (2010) 203-212; AT THE TWO MONTH FOLLOW-UP FOR THE BARE-METAL STENT (BX-VELOCITY) ARM OF THE STUDY, THERE WERE 7 CASES OF RESTENOSIS OF THE STENT, (THE AUTHOR NOTED THAT TWO OF THE CASES WERE OCCLUSIONS). AT THE 6 MONTH FOLLOW-UP, 6 PATIENTS HAD RESTENOSIS (THE AUTHOR NOTED THAT 1 OF THE CASES WAS AN OCCLUSION). THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED AS A FEASIBILITY TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE USE OF GP LIB/ILIA BLOCKADE IN CONNECTION WITH DRUG ELUTING STENTS, BARE STENTS AND PTA ONLY. SIXTY-THREE LIMBS IN SIXTY PATIENTS WITH CURRENT ULCERS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE REVASCULARIZATION OF INFRAGENICULAR OCCLUSION OR STENOSIS WITH ABCIXIMAB PLUS A CYPHER SELECT SIROLIMUS COATED STENT (14 LIMBS), ABCIXIMAB PLUS A BX- VELOCITY BARE STENT (16 LIMBS/16 PATIENTS), ABCIXIMAB PLUS PTA (14 LIMBS) AND PTA ALONE (19 LIMBS). FOR THE BX-VELOCITY BARE METAL STENT, THE TARGET LESIONS WERE LOCATED IN THE FOLLOWING VESSELS: ONE IN THE TIBIOPERONEAL TRUNK , THREE IN THE ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY, THREE IN THE POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY, AND NINE IN THE PERONEAL ARTERY. SIX OF THE LESIONS WERE OCCLUSIONS WITH A MEAN STENOSIS RATE OF 87.7%. THE AVERAGE LESION LENGTH WAS 3.5CM + OR ¿ 1.7CM, AND THE VESSEL DIAMETER WAS 2.8 + OR ¿ 0.25MM. NINE LIMBS HAD 1 RUN-OFF VESSEL, 2 LIMBS HAD TWO RUN-OFF VESSELS, AND ONE LIMB HAD 3 RUN-OFF VESSELS. THERE WERE NO PERIPROCEDURAL ADVERSE EVENTS OR EARLY THROMBOTIC OCCLUSIONS IN THE 30-DAY POST-PROCEDURAL INTERVAL. NO BLEEDING EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. IN ALL CASES, RECANALIZATION WAS SUCCESSFUL. INITIAL TECHNICAL SUCCESS AS DEFINED BY STENOSIS SMALLER THAN 30% COULD BE ACHIEVED IN ALL CASES. MEAN RESIDUAL STENOSIS WAS 0.7% IN THE BARE METAL STENT GROUP. FOR FOLLOW-UP, RESTENOSIS OF THE TARGET LESION AND THE SECONDARY LESION WAS ASSESSED BY ANGIOGRAPHY AT 2 AND 6 MONTHS. THE ANGIOGRAM WAS OBTAINED IN TWO PROJECTIONS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. THE TWO MONTH FOLLOW-UP WAS CONDUCTED IN 11 PATIENTS. IN THIS INTERVAL, NO PATIENT DIED. MEAN STENOSIS WAS 45.4 + OR - 44.6%. TWO TOTAL OCCLUSIONS WERE OBSERVED, IN ONE CASE REINTERVENTION WAS ATTEMPTED AND WAS SUCCESSFUL. INCLUDING THE OCCLUSIONS, FIVE PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH RESTENOSIS. ULCUS SIZE DECREASED TO 5.3±7.5 CM2¿ ONE LOWER LEG AMPUTATION HAD TO BE CONDUCTED IN THE TWO MONTH INTERVAL. THEREFORE, 7 CASES OF RESTENOSIS WERE IDENTIFIED, INCLUDING TWO OCCLUSIONS.

ONE ADDITIONAL LOWER LEG AMPUTATION HAD TO BE CARRIED OUT. MEAN RESTENOSIS AT SIX MONTHS WAS 67±42.9%. ONE OCCLUSION WAS TREATED WITH A RESIDUAL STENOSIS OF 70%. THEREFORE, AT SIX MONTHS, A TOTAL OF SIX PATIENTS HAD RESTENOSIS. THE LONG-TERM TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED FOR 14 PATIENTS. IN THE MEANTIME, THREE OF THE PATIENTS HAD DIED, ONE BECAUSE OF KIDNEY FAILURE, ONE FROM CARDIAC FAILURE AND ONE FROM TRAUMA. THE FIRST OF THESE HAD HAD ADDITIONAL MINOR AMPUTATION. NEXT TO THAT, TWO FURTHER MINOR AMPUTATIONS HAD TO BE CONDUCTED. THE DEVICE REMAINS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT; THEREFORE, IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER. IN-STENT RESTENOSIS (ISR) IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRESSION OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE AND IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOWING STENT IMPLANTATION AND DOES NOT REPRESENT A DEVICE FAILURE. INTRA-ARTERIAL STENT PLACEMENT IS A TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE PROCESS, IT IS NOT A PREVENTIVE OR CURE FOR THE PROGRESSION OF SYMPTOMS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC ARTERY DISEASE THAT LED TO THE NEED FOR INITIAL STENT PLACEMENT. VESSEL OCCLUSION, RESTENOSIS, INTIMAL HYPERPLASIA OR RECURRENT STRICTURES ARE WELL KNOWN DOCUMENTED POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS OF THIS TYPE OF PROCEDURE AND ARE LISTED IN THE IFU AS SUCH. IN THE LITERATURE, IN-STENT STENOSIS RATES RANGE FROM 11% TO 39% FROM 6 TO 12 MONTHS AFTER STENT PLACEMENT. RATES WERE HIGHER IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH MORE SEVERE ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND DEPENDED ON THE TYPE OF STENOSIS TREATED. ISR IS MORE PREVALENT IN OSTIAL STENT PLACEMENT PROCEDURES. STENOSES IN STENTS ARE USUALLY TREATED WITH INTRASTENT PTA OR PLACEMENT OF A SECOND STENT. FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THIS EVENT INCLUDE PATIENT, PROCEDURAL, PHARMACOLOGICAL AND LESION. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE EVENT WAS RELATED TO A DESIGN OR MANUFACTURING ISSUE, THEREFORE, NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN AT THIS TIME.

4730303|03/01/2015|IN|NIQ|LITERATURE CITATION: KUROSAWA ET AL. 2015. A CASE OF ACTIVE PERI-STENT INFLAMMATION AFTER SIROLIMUS-ELUTING STENT IMPLANTATION. HEART VESSELS, 30, 270-273. COMPLAINT CONCLUSION: AS REPORTED THROUGH A PUBLISHED ARTICLE, A CYPHER STENT WAS NOTED TO BE INCOMPLETELY EXPANDED. THE PATIENT IS REPORTED TO HAVE EXPIRED THREE YEARS LATER RELATED TO SEPSIS AS A RESULT OF CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA. THE EVENT INVOLVED A (B)(6) FEMALE PATIENT WITH A PAST MEDICAL HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION, CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, ISCHEMIC STROKE AND CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING. SHE PRESENTED WITH SYMPTOMS OF CARDIAC ISCHEMIA, WAS NOTED TO HAVE A TARGET LESION IN HER CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY AND UNDERWENT 2.5 X 15MM CYPHER STENT IMPLANTATION. FINAL INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND (IVUS) REVEALED NO RESIDUAL STENOSIS BUT AN INCOMPLETELY EXPANDED STENT. THIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FURTHER TREATED WITH POST DILATION WITH A NON-COMPLIANT BALLOON AT 22 ATMOSPHERES. POST-PROCEDURALLY, THE PATIENT RECEIVED ANTICOAGULANT AND ANTIPLATELET MEDICATIONS WITH NO FURTHER EVIDENCE OF ISCHEMIC EVENTS. APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS AFTER THE INDEX PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT EXPIRED FROM SEPSIS RELATED TO HER CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA. A POSTMORTEM PATHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION REVEALED NO ACUTE ISCHEMIC CHANGES TO THE MYOCARDIUM; ALTHOUGH THE EXAM DID REVEAL INTENSE LYMPHOCYTIC AND EOSINOPHILIC INFILTRATION IN THE CORONARY ARTERY AROUND THE AREA OF THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED CYPHER STENT. THIS WAS ESPECIALLY EVIDENT IN THE ADVENTITIA. THERE WAS THINNING OF THE MEDIAL LAYER CONSISTING OF SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS, DUE TO VASCULAR INJURY FOLLOWING THE STENT DEPLOYMENT. THE CRESCENTIC SPACE IN THE MID CIRCUMFLEX CORRESPONDED TO THE AREA OF THE RECONSTRUCTION, WHICH WAS CREATED BY HIGH-PRESSURE DILATATION WITH A 2.75 X 10 MM NON-COMPLIANT BALLOON INFLATED TO A PRESSURE OF 22 ATMOSPHERES. THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER. ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCT INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE, USERS ARE INSTRUCTED AT SEVERAL POINTS IN THE DOCUMENT THAT THE OPTIMAL STENT EXPANSION REQUIRES THE STENT TO BE IN FULL CONTACT WITH THE ARTERY WALL, WITH THE STENT INTERNAL DIAMETER MATCHING THE SIZE OF THE REFERENCE VESSEL DIAMETER. STENT WALL CONTACT SHOULD BE VERIFIED THROUGH ROUTINE ANGIOGRAPHY OR IVUS. THEY ARE FURTHER INSTRUCTED TO CONFIRM ADEQUATE STENT EXPANSION BY ANGIOGRAPHIC INJECTION THROUGH THE GUIDE CATHETER. ALL EFFORTS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ASSURE THAT THE STENT IS NOT UNDER-DILATED. IF THE DEPLOYED STENT SIZE IS STILL INADEQUATE OR IF FULL CONTACT WITH THE VESSEL IS NOT ACHIEVED, THE STENT MAY BE FURTHER EXPANDED USING A LOW PROFILE, HIGH PRESSURE, AND NON-COMPLIANT BALLOON CATHETER. THE USER IS CAUTIONED TO NOT DILATE THE STENT BEYOND 3.5MM (FOR A STENT WITH A NOMINAL STENT DIAMETER OF 2.25-3.00MM. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT FACTORS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED ISSUE; THOUGH THE ARTICLE DOES APPEAR TO IMPLICATE THE POST-DILATION OF THE STENT IN THE POST-MORTEM FINDINGS. WITHOUT THE RETURN OF THE DEVICE FOR ANALYSIS, THE REPORTED EVENT COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED AND NO DETERMINATION OF POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS COULD BE MADE. WITHOUT A LOT NUMBER TO CONDUCT A MANUFACTURING REVIEW, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE IF THE REPORTED EVENT COULD BE RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THEREFORE, NO CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN AT THIS TIME.
4736184|01/28/2015|IN|NIQ|IT WAS FURTHER REPORTED THAT IN (B)(6) 2015, SUBSEQUENT HOSPITALIZATIONS SHOWED PERSISTENT COLOPATHY AND THE PATIENT WAS WEANED OFF FROM VASOPRESSORS AND SUPPORTIVE MEDICATION. HOWEVER THE PATIENT CONTINUED POOR DIETARY INTAKE, PERCUTANEOUS ENDOSCOPIC GASTROSTOMY (PEG) WAS CONSIDERED BUT WAS POSTPONED DUE TO MARGINAL RESPIRATORY STATUS AND WAS CONTINUED ON CENTRAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION (CPN). IN (B)(6) 2015, THE PATIENT'S HEALTH STARTED TO DECLINE AND HENCE WAS TAKEN TO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU). DURING THE TRANSITION, THE PATIENT HAD CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST AND CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (CPR) WAS INITIATED. DUE TO THE PATIENT'S CONDITION OF LONG HYPOXEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, RESUSCITATION WAS ABORTED. THE PATIENT EXPIRED DUE TO RESPIRATORY FAILURE. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF DEATH WAS RESPIRATORY FAILURE/CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST. NO AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED.

4839187|05/18/2015|IN|MAF|(B)(4). DURING PROCESSING OF THIS COMPLAINT, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO OBTAIN COMPLETE EVENT, PATIENT AND DEVICE INFORMATION. A THIRD 2.8X16MM GRAFTMASTER FAILED TO CROSS TO TREAT THE DISTAL PORTION OF THE PERFORATION DUE TO RESISTANCE WITH THE DEPLOYED STENT IN THE PROXIMAL LESION. THE STENT IMPLANT BECAME FLARED; THUS THE GRAFTMASTER WAS REMOVED. THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED CARDIAC ARREST AND CPR WAS PERFORMED. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 85 MINUTES OF RESUSCITATION ATTEMPTS, TREATMENTS WERE STOPPED AND THE PATIENT EXPIRED. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS NOTED TO BE THE PERFORATION OF THE LAD VESSEL. THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED. IT IS INDICATED THAT THE DEVICE IS NOT RETURNING FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE A FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. A REVIEW OF THE LOT HISTORY RECORD REVEALED NO NON-CONFORMANCES. THE RESULTS OF THE QUERY OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN THE COMPLAINT HANDLING DATABASE FOR THIS LOT DID NOT INDICATE A MANUFACTURING ISSUE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION REVIEWED, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURE, DESIGN, OR LABELING. THE OTHER TWO 2.80X16MM GRAFTMASTER DEVICES REFERENCED ARE BEING FILED UNDER SEPARATE MEDWATCH MFR NUMBERS.
4847536|05/18/2015|IN|MAF|(B)(4). EVENT DESCRIPTION CONTINUED: ANOTHER 2.8X16MM GRAFTMASTER WAS ADVANCED BUT FAILED TO CROSS TO TREAT THE DISTAL PORTION OF THE PERFORATION DUE TO RESISTANCE WITH THE DEPLOYED STENT IN THE PROXIMAL LESION. THE STENT IMPLANT BECAME FLARED; THUS THE GRAFTMASTER WAS REMOVED. THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED CARDIAC ARREST AND CPR WAS PERFORMED. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 85 MINUTES OF RESUSCITATION ATTEMPTS, TREATMENTS WERE STOPPED AND THE PATIENT EXPIRED. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS NOTED TO BE THE PERFORATION OF THE LAD VESSEL. THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED. (B)(4) - DISTAL TO STENT: IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE GRAFTMASTER CORONARY STENT GRAFT SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) STATES: IF MORE THAN ONE STENT GRAFT IS REQUIRED, THE DISTAL STENT GRAFT SHOULD BE PLACED INITIALLY, FOLLOWED BY PLACEMENT OF THE PROXIMAL STENT GRAFT. STENT GRAFT PLACEMENT IN THIS ORDER OBVIATES THE NEED TO CROSS THE PROXIMAL STENT GRAFT WHEN PLACING THE DISTAL STENT GRAFT, AND REDUCES THE CHANCES FOR DISLODGING THE PROXIMAL STENT GRAFT. IT IS INDICATED THAT THE DEVICE IS NOT RETURNING FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE A FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. A REVIEW OF THE LOT HISTORY RECORD REVEALED NO NON-CONFORMANCES. A QUERY OF THE ELECTRONIC COMPLAINT HANDLING DATABASE REVEALED NO OTHER INCIDENTS FOR FAILURE TO ADVANCE OR MATERIAL DEFORMATION (FLARED STENT) REPORTED FROM THIS LOT. BASED ON THE INFORMATION REVIEWED, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURE, DESIGN ,OR LABELING. THE OTHER TWO 2.80X16MM GRAFTMASTER DEVICES REFERENCED ARE BEING FILED UNDER SEPARATE MEDWATCH MFR NUMBERS.

QUANTITATIVE CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY (QCA) WAS PERFORMED TO ANALYZE DIFFERENCES OF STENT LENGTH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE POST-DEPLOYMENT AND FINAL POST-PROCEDURE. INDEPENDENT FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH LONGITUDINAL STENT DEFORMATION (LSD) WERE IDENTIFIED. CLINICAL OUTCOMES AT 3 YEARS WERE COMPARED BETWEEN THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT QCA BASED LSD. LESION RELATED (OSTIAL LESION, LEFT MAIN LESION SEVERE CALCIFICATION), AND PROCEDURE-RELATED RISK FACTORS (BIFURCATION TREATMENT WITH SB STENTING, ADDITIONAL DOWNSTREAM PCI, IVUS OR OCT USE, ADJUNCTIVE POBA, BIFURCATION TREATMENT WITH SB BALLOONING) WERE PRESENT IN 82 CASES OF LSD . THE 3-YEAR CLINICAL OUTCOMES INCLUDED DEATH, MI, TVR, STENT THROMBOSIS AND TARGET LESION FAILURE. ONLY 1 CASE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL STENTING FOR LSD AND 1 PATIENT DIED OF NONCARDIAC CAUSE DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD.
8023258|09/24/2018|M|MAF|DURING A PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION (PCI) OF THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD), A PERFORATION OCCURRED. THE MD USED A GRAFTMASTER STENT TO TRY AND CONTROL THE BLEEDING FROM THE PERFORATION, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DEPLOY THE STENT INTO THE AREA OF PERFORATION DUE TO THE SMALL VESSEL SIZE. WHEN THE GRAFTMASTER STENT COULD NOT BE DEPLOYED WELL AT THE AREA OF PERFORATION, THE PHYSICIAN INJECTED GELFOAM TO THE AREA TO SEAL THE LAD. PATIENT EXPIRED FROM CARDIAC ARREST AFTER THE LAD WAS OCCLUDED WITH GELFOAM. REPORT FORM SENT TO ABBOTT, THE COMPANY THAT PRODUCES THE GRAFTMASTER STENT. DEVICE NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURN.
8064964|10/30/2018|IN|MAF|REPORTEDLY, A VERTEBRAL ARTERY LACERATION OCCURRED DURING SPINE SURGERY. THE PATIENT WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST AND ADVANCE CARDIAC LIFE SUPPORT (ACLS) PROTOCOLS WERE INITIATED. VASCULAR SURGERY WAS COUNSELED EMERGENTLY FOR INTRAOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND INTERVENTION. IN AN EFFORT TO STABILIZE THE PATIENT CARDIAC COMPRESSIONS WERE STARTED. THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE IMPROVED RAPID ARTERIALIZED BLOOD FLOW WAS NOTED TO BE EMERGING FROM THE CERVICAL SPINE. A VERTEBRAL ARTERY INJURY WAS SUSPECTED; HOWEVER, THE VESSEL WAS TIGHTLY LODGED BETWEEN TWO BONY STRUCTURES AND COULD NOT BE EXPOSED FOR LIGATION OR SURGICAL REPAIR. DIRECT PRESSURE WAS USED TO AID IN HEMOSTASIS. DURING THIS TIME THE PATIENT BECAME HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE ONCE AGAIN. FURTHER ACLS PROTOCOL WAS PERFORMED. A GUIDE WIRE AND NON-ABBOTT CATHETER WERE ADVANCED INTO THE LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY. MULTIPLE IMAGES WERE PERFORMED WHICH ULTIMATELY REVEALED EXTRAVASATION OF CONTRAST FROM THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. A 2.8X19MM RX GRAFTMASTER COVERED STENT ADVANCED; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPRESSIONS, DIRECT PRESSURE BEING HELD, AND MULTIPLE DEVICES IN THE OPERATIVE FIELD, IMAGING WAS DIFFICULT. A HEMOSTAT WAS PLACED DIRECTLY OVER THE ARTERIAL INJURY. THE COVERED STENT WAS ALIGNED WITH THE HEMOSTAT AND DEPLOYED. THROMBIN AND GELFOAM WERE PACKED DIRECTLY OVER THE ARTERIAL BLEEDING SITE AND DIRECT PRESSURE WAS HELD. SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED BLEEDING WAS NOTED. DESPITE DECREASED BLEEDING THE PATIENT REMAINED HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 1.5 HOURS OF ACLS PROTOCOL THE PATIENT COULD NOT BE RESUSCITATED.
